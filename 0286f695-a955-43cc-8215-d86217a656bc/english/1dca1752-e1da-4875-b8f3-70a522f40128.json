      "This word, which is taken from Job twenty-eight, when carefully considered, opens the way for us to pre-recognize the fourfold kind of cause in the book of Sentences, namely material, formal, efficient and final.",
      "For the material cause is hinted at in the name of rivers, the formal cause in the exploration of depths, the final cause in the revelation of hidden things, and the efficient cause is understood in the supposition of two words, namely he has searched and brought to light."

      "The material cause is hinted at by the name of rivers in the plural, not singular, so that not only is the whole matter or subject of the book touched upon in general, but also of particular books in particular.",
      "For this reason it should be noted that, according to the fourfold property of the material river, there is a fourfold spiritual river, about which, according to the fourfold difference, there are four books of Sentences.",
      "For I consider the material river as to its duration, and I find perpetuity. For as Isidore says:",
      "\"A river is a perennial flow\".",
      "I consider it as to its extension, and I find spaciousness.",
      "For in this the river is distinguished from the stream.",
      "I consider it as to its motion, and I find circulation.",
      "For as it is said in Ecclesiastes one:",
      "To the place from which the rivers come, they return etc.",
      "I consider its effect, and I find purification.",
      "For the river, because of the abundance of waters, cleanses the lands through which it runs, so that it is not polluted.",
      "And since all who transfer according to some likeness transfer, from this fourfold condition taken as a metaphor, a fourfold spiritual river is found, as we can gather from the Scriptures."
