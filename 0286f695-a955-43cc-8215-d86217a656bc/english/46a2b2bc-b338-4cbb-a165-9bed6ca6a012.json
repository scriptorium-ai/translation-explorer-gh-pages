      "The Ancient of Days sat, and a fiery and swift river flowed from his face.",
      "This Ancient of Days is the eternal Father, whose antiquity is eternity. This Ancient sat, for not only is eternity in him, but also immutability.",
      "From the face of this Ancient flowed a fiery and swift river, that is, from the sublimity of his divinity proceeded the fullness of love and the fullness of power:",
      "the fullness of power in the Son, therefore the river was swift;",

      "And I will put a bridle in your jaws etc.",
      "This great dragon, whom the Lord addresses and threatens in the figure and person of Pharaoh, is the devil, who is the king of Egypt, for he reigns over those whom he has blinded with the darkness of error, such as heretics, to whom he also says:",
      "The river is mine, and I made myself, as if he himself made this world and he has no other principle.",
      "This error he spoke and suggested to the impious Manicheans, who contend that the whole machine of visible things was created by an evil God.",
      "The Lord will bridle the jaws of this dragon, when, having removed his power to suggest falsehoods, he will show that he is the creator of this river;",

      "Thirdly, due to its circulation, the river is said to be the incarnation of the Son of God, for as in a circle the last is joined to the first, so in the incarnation the highest is joined to the lowest, as God to the clay, and the first to the last, as the eternal Son of God to man created on the sixth day.",
      "Of this river, Ecclesiasticus twenty-four:",
      "I am like the river Dorix, and like an aqueduct I came out of paradise.",
      "Dorix is interpreted as the medicine of generation, and there is a figurative speech, so that it is understood conversely, that is, the generation of medicine.",
      "For the incarnation of the Son of God was nothing else than the generation of medicine:",
      "For he truly bore our infirmities and carried our diseases.",
      "Therefore, the incarnation of the Son is rightly called the river Dorix.",
      "And Christ himself truly says of himself:",
      "I am like the river Dorix, that is, the medicinal river, and like an aqueduct I came out of paradise.",
      "The nature of water is such that it rises as much as it descends.",
      "Such was the exit of the incarnation, according to what is said in the Psalm:",
      "From the highest heaven is his going forth, and his meeting is unto the highest of it.",
      "And John sixteen:",
      "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and I go to the Father, and so he made a circle.",
      "Of this river also as to his going forth from his mother can be explained that which is said in Esther ten in the dream of Mardochaeus: A little brook grew into a river, and was turned into light and the sun. Who, I pray, is this little brook but the humble virgin? She grew into a river, when she begot Christ, who is not only a river through the abundance of grace, but also the light of wisdom and the sun of justice, according to what John says in the first chapter about him: He was the true light etc."

      "Fourthly, due to its cleansing, the river is said to be the dispensation of the Sacraments, which cleanses us from the defilements of sins without polluting itself. Of this river, Revelation twenty-two: He showed me a river of living water, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb. The dispensation of the Sacraments is called a river clear as crystal for the clarity and brightness, which it leaves in the souls, which are purified in this river. It is also called a river of living water for the efficacy of grace, which vivifies the soul. This also proceeds from the throne of God and of the Lamb. For sacramental grace proceeds from God as from the author and efficient cause, from Christ as from the mediator and the one who merits it. For this reason all the Sacraments are said to have efficacy from the passion of Christ; hence Augustine testifies: \"From the side of the sleeping Christ flowed the Sacraments, when from there flowed blood and water\"."
