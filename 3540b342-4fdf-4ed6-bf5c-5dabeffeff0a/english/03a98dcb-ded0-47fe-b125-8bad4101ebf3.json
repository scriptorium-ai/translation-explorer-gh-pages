      "But in order for the imposed truth to be revealed, it will be necessary first to understand the nature of light and brightness: therefore, we will distinguish this kind, which has a common name, which the Greeks call φως and the Latins call light, into three species, into light, ray, and brightness; light is that glow which is in a bright body, by which the bright body is adorned and conspicuous, just as we call the light of the Sun that glow by which the Sun itself shines and is adorned.",
      "The ray, however, is light produced from a bright body, and remaining, and not in any way separated from it, but brightness, as it is something distinct from both, is secondary light, or a kind and image of produced light and rays, which is also seen separated from the ray, and in the shadow.",
      "But these differ among themselves; for light is visible by itself, indeed the first visible thing, the ray or produced light is not visible by itself, but brightness, both is visible by itself, and is the reason for seeing other things, light is visible by itself, for bright bodies are conspicuous by their nature, indeed the first visible thing, since it does not need another, to be seen, for light does not need secondary brightness, to be conspicuous, just as colors need, which move the illuminated transparent, but it itself moves the transparent, to be transparent; therefore, both in darkness, and in light it is conspicuous, as is evident from fire, which is seen when lit at night, while we are otherwise in darkness, and in stars, which can hardly spread thin rays to the earth due to the very long distance, by which secondary light can be produced, yet they themselves are sufficiently shining, and sufficiently conspicuous, and the more so, the more the night has been dark.",
      "Indeed, it is far from the case that bright things require the help of light to be seen, since they are rather not seen at all because of its presence; which is why many bright things are not seen during the day, but are conspicuous at night, and we do not see stars placed in the illuminated air, but we do see them in the dark, as when we descend into a well, of which we will give a more exact reason below; but this first belongs to light, to be visible by itself, for the ray is not visible, unless it ends at something opaque, but light is also visible in the transparent, and clear without end, brightness is visible, but not first, but by reason of the ray ending at something opaque from which it flows as its kind, and image, therefore light is first, and by itself visible, and the first object of sight, the ray, which is both produced light, and flowing from the light of a bright body is not visible by itself, as is evident from experience, for in the transparent where it is produced by its nature, it is not seen at all, therefore the ray produced in the truly transparent transparent even if it is produced to infinity, is never visible, unless it ends at something opaque: this is clearly known, first, because if the ray is admitted into a dark room through some hole, to which another opposite responds, so that the admitted ray by a straight path through one hole goes out through the other, and passes, neither will the room be illuminated, nor will the ray be conspicuous, secondly, because the Sun during the day emits luminous rays through the whole hemisphere, which however are not seen except near the earth, and opaque bodies from which they are reflected, although they are not seen at all in the upper air, which is between the sky, and the earth, unless they have been reflected from the clouds as if they were opaque.",
      "Thirdly, because the same Sun at night spreads its rays over the whole sky; although they do not illuminate the sky itself, unless they are received in the stars themselves as if in solid, and dense parts of the sky, I said however that the ray produced in the truly transparent transparent is not visible; for there are two kinds of transparent; one, which is transparent by its nature, and truly transparent, as long as it is simple, and pure in its nature: the other however which is not truly transparent even if it is preserved in its pure, and unmixed nature.",
      "The first kind of transparent are, the sky, Aether, or, what they say, the fire contiguous to the sky, and the air; but the sky is truly, and first transparent, because it is the simplest, and admits no mixture of foreign matter, next to this comes the fire contiguous to it, and in third place comes the air, which by its nature is truly transparent, but because of the mixture of vapors, and foreign body it does not always exist as truly transparent, but the second kind of transparent are, water, crystal, glass, gems, and other things of this kind, which partly because of the mixed earthy portion, as they are mixed imperfect partly because of the thickness of the parts, as water, and ice are not perfectly transparent.",
      "But in order for this to be well understood it is necessary to suppose what is transparent.",
      "But the transparent is properly transparent, to translate word for word, or clear, or translucent, but this signifies nothing else, except, that it admits light, and transmits it, and therefore the transparent differs from the opaque, because the transparent not only admits light on the surface, but also into the whole depth, therefore, it both admits, and transmits light, the opaque however only on the surface in no way however into the depth, therefore those which according to the whole of their mass are pervious to light, and conspicuous, are called transparent, but those which are contrary, are not transparent, and opaque: and truly transparent are entirely pervious to light, conspicuous from all sides, and translucent, and also receptive of light when a bright body approaches, and of darkness when it recedes, so that rightly if we wish to define the absolutely clear, as clear, it must be said that it is, what is potentially light, and darkness, for the transparent body is indifferent to light, and darkness, as Arist. taught in the second book on the soul cap.7. part.69. therefore the clear, which is truly clear is such, therefore, the ray or light produced from a bright body is neither reflected, nor refracted by a truly clear body; it is clear, first in the sky whose substance distinct from the stars is entirely pervious to the rays of the Sun at night, so that the rays are neither reflected, nor refracted by it, as is evident, because no conspicuous light is made in it, which would necessarily be made, if the rays were either reflected, or refracted by it, and also it is clear from this, that all the stars both fixed, and wandering above the sphere of the moon are conspicuous without any reflection, or refraction of light being made, as if they were in the sphere of the moon, because of the perfect transparency of the celestial substance, so that, unless we were warned by this difference of motion in speed, and slowness, we would by no means be able to discern whether they were fixed in one or in several spheres.",
      "Therefore the sky is most perfectly transparent in that part, where there are no stars, next indeed is the contiguous aether, which we see to be so clear, that it is not allowed to distinguish it from the sky by sense, which was the cause, that many, and very learned men thought that there is no sky above us, but that all things are filled with this purest aether, and that the stars move and are moved in it like fish, and animals, as if in a very vast sea, next to this comes the air, which when it is pure, and sincere, is truly, and itself clear, therefore neither is it distinguished from the substance of the aether, or the sky nor is light in any way reflected, or refracted by it, as is clear, but indeed when it is mixed with vapors it is not truly transparent, from which it happens, that its rays are often refracted by it.",
      "These things about truly transparent bodies; but not truly transparent are, water even if it is very pure, nor ice because of the density of the parts, nor glass, or crystal, nor gems because of some, which it retains of earth, (although very thin, and elaborate) portion, the argument is, that rays are refracted by all these, therefore, and the ray in these is always visible, which would not happen at all, if they were truly transparent, for then the ray would pervade them from all sides, and would not have an obstacle from which it would be refracted, for then refraction happens, as the Perspectivists say, when the ray is poured out through another transparent of unequal clarity.",
      "Therefore the ray, or light immediately produced from a bright body in the truly transparent transparent is not visible, unless it ends at some opaque thing.",
      "But brightness, both is visible, and is the reason for seeing.",
      "Visible I say insofar as it is the act of the transparent, as transparent, because it is as if color of the clear, when the clear is in act, as Aristot. taught in the tenth book on the soul cap. & the aforementioned parts, and sense shows; for clear things are judged by the eye under the aspect of the clear, by means of light, for we do not know that crystal, or glass, or water, or air are clear in darkness, which Aristot. very well signified in the second book on the soul par. 68. saying, [But I call clear, what is indeed visible not however visible by itself, as I simply say, but because of the external color] as if to say clear is, what is naturally apt to be seen, not however by itself, for in darkness it is not naturally apt to be seen, unless insofar as it is susceptible of motion from a bright body, as at night from the stars, or from fire, or some such unnamed bright thing, nor in light, unless insofar as it is informed by light, for in this way it represents all colors, and it itself appears stripped of every color kind, and is the reason for seeing, which is evident from this, because placed above the sensory organ it does not hinder sense, but rather makes sense, for the eye, and the crystalline humor, unless illuminated do not feel color, which would not happen if it were only visible, and not the reason for seeing, for the sensible thing placed above the sensory organ does not make sense.",
      "Therefore brightness is, both a real, and physical quality, because it is sensible; and also intentional, because it is the reason for seeing.",
      "But indeed it is worth the effort to declare in what way brightness itself as a real, and intentional quality is produced, but it must be supposed, that what Aristotle says in the often cited place 2. on the soul cap.7. part.69. & 70. light is the presence of a bright body in the clear, which is to be understood causally without doubt not formally, from which it follows that the bright body in the clear causes two things, the ray, which is nothing else, than light first produced from a bright body, and brightness, which is the act of the transparent, but brightness is not produced by the ray in the transparent, unless it has first ended at something opaque, and therefore it is usually called second light.",
      "Brightness itself this; act of the transparent, or secondary light is nothing else, than a certain image, and species of the ray, and of light first produced, just as indeed in the illuminated transparent, the body actually colored produces its species, which in the middle of the transparent without end is not seen, but in the terminated transparent is seen, as is evident in images, which we see are not at all referred from crystals not terminated by lead, but indeed are referred from terminated ones: so the ray received in the terminated transparent produces that image, which before in the transparent without end had not been visible, because it flowed out, nor was it retained, from the nature of the terminated transparent it is visibly retained, and referred, not indeed reflected.",
      "For the image is not reflected, but produced by the ray terminated, and reflected or refracted in the transparent; so that the transparent itself immediately actuates, and perfects the whole everywhere not according to the nature of dimensions, and capacity induced, but in a corporeal, and in a measured way, and entirely, thus received in the middle, just as the images of other visible things are received in the eye without matter, namely, which is also common to other sensible things, nor in a material way, for neither does the colored surface offer itself to me by parts, nor according to that dimension according to which it is received through the hole of the Vueae, and the pupil: although not without the conditions of matter; for I see a two-foot whiteness, or blackness, and this is to be light a quality, as they say intentional just as we say that the species of things, which are sensed, and the image in the mirror, which for this reason, and is represented whole in the whole mirror, and whole in any part of the mirror, and the voice, which is heard whole by one man, and whole by countless as we will explain more fully in our commentaries which on the books of Aristotle on the soul with God's help we will publish soon.",
      "But how this same quality of light can at the same time be real, and intentional, so that it is both sensible, and the reason for sensing will be worth the effort to declare, for with this established many, and very difficult difficulties will cease, and be dissolved.",
      "For the declaration of this: it is first necessary to know that of physical qualities some are drawn out of the potential of matter, but others are not, but are rather induced into matter, and the subject, although indeed to be drawn out of the potential of matter, first and by itself belongs to substantial forms, yet it also belongs to accidental ones, which Aristotle taught in the first book of Physics. saying that from the unmusical the musical is made, and from the not white the white.",
      "Qualities drawn out of the potential of matter are those, the privation of which before they are, is in matter, that is those whose subject is naturally apt to have such habits, and qualities, but this aptitude is under the contrary habit, and quality, as when we say that heat is potentially in wood, because wood is naturally apt to be burned, and to have heat, but this aptitude before the wood is heated is under the contrary habit, namely under the cold itself these qualities are said to be drawn out of the potential of matter, because through the contrary habit gradually excluding the prior quality another contrary quality is introduced, which was before potentially in matter, not however in act, although this is not properly to be drawn out of the potential of matter, but improperly, since this change is made in the subject in act: therefore when from the unmusical the musical is made, it is said to be accidental transmutation, but only substantial forms are drawn out of the potential of matter, since they suppose the subject potentially; and from them, and the subject one per se is made, and therefore it can rather be said, that all qualities are induced into the subject, for either they follow the form, and then they are induced by the generator, for the agent giving the form, gives the consequences of the form, or they precede the form, and then they are equally included by the alterer, yet of qualities some are, which are so introduced into the subject, that this does not happen without the fight, and resistance of the contrary quality, as are the four first tangible qualities hot, cold, wet, and dry, and those which come from these second, hard soft, rough, smooth, and the rest, and these indeed are introduced in time, and are received by means of dimensions, but others are, which are received in the subject without the resistance of the contrary, and these are introduced immediately, and suddenly, and are not received by means of dimensions such is light, and irradiation, and altogether the reception of color in the middle, although indeed all sensible qualities, are so received in the sense;",
      "but not all are so received in the middle, for neither is sound received in the ___ body, unless with the air struck, nor less odor, unless with smoky exhalation,"
