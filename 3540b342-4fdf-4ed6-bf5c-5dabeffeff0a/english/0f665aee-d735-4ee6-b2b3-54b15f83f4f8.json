      "Therefore, either these phenomena must be attributed to real mountains, valleys, and truly protruding or depressed parts existing on the moon, or to apparent, but not real, and as has been sufficiently demonstrated so far, it is not possible for there to be real mountains and valleys there, since they can neither be of the same nature as ours and made of sublunar material, nor of a different nature, or made of celestial substance: it remains to conclude that these are only spectres, and mere appearances of valley movements, of valleys, seas, islands, and peninsulas;",
      "but not the forms and appearances of real bodies, which, although it will be very difficult to prove against a most learned man armed with geometric and optical reasoning.",
      "yet I will attempt to bring forward a reasonably probable argument, fortified by the sharpness of some great man, and if I have not secured the aim of my proposal, I will not regret the effort, for others may perhaps be stirred from this to investigate the truer cause, or Galileo himself, stirred by these stimuli, will carry out what he has already promised to say in the system of the world, and will more fully and openly explain and confirm his opinion on these matters, but let us return to where we left off.",
      "The spectres and apparitions of these phenomena, if they are not of real bodies, can occur in two ways, namely if these things appear in the moon as in a mirror, and in a highly polished body, the images of our mountains, provinces, and seas, a similar opinion was recounted by Plutarch in his treatise on the face in the moon's orb, saying that some thought that those large spots appearing in the moon were the image of the outer sea;",
      "Agesianax's poems referring to this, which he thus sang."

    [
      "Either the image of the immense sea, roaring on its opposite side,"
    ],
    [
      "Is represented in the burning mirror."

      "Although Kepler reports that this opinion pleased the majesty of Caesar Rudolph Augustus, when he seemed to see the image of Italy offered in the moon's spots, but this opinion is refuted both by Plutarch and by others, for me one argument against it is sufficient, which Averroes uses in the second part of his work on the sky, part 49, where he says that if this blackness, which appears in the moon, were the idol of the forms of bodies, which are here as some imagine, that it is the idol of the forms of seas, or seas, because if it were so, there would be a diversity of aspect for them, because the cause of this would be nothing but reflection, and reflection is only towards defined places.",
      "Therefore, since the spots appearing in the moon, both old and new, always keep the same position, this cannot be due to the reflection of the image of these lower things.",
      "The other way these phenomena can occur is from the mixture of light and dark, just as we see painters showing images of bodies that are sometimes prominent, sometimes depressed, sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes whole and continuous, sometimes perforated and gaping, from the various mixtures of these things on the same completely flat and smooth surface, which we see more clearly in clouds illuminated by the opposite Sun, which, since they do not admit the Sun's rays from all sides, show various spectres mixed from light and dark, which, assuming this, we will also accept the other, namely that the lunar globe consists of light and dark, it will perhaps not be difficult to assign the cause of these phenomena:",
      "But that the lunar globe is composed of dark and light, I believe everyone admits, since it is the weakest of all stars, and therefore, as Aristotle said in the first book of the Meteorologica, chapter 40, in it this is purer, that other less sincere, and elsewhere he said that it is similar to the earth, not that the moon is made up of completely dissimilar bodies, as these lower ones are composed, for this detracts from the very simplicity of the sky itself; which we have demonstrated above, but because in the moon some parts are more permeable to light, and more transparent, and clear, others are less permeable, and less transparent, and dark, nor is it absurd for these differences to exist in the moon, although it is an incorruptible body;",
      "since these differences belong to it insofar as it is a body susceptible of light, but illumination is a perfecting passion, not a corrupting one.",
      "But that the moon is a body neither perfectly opaque, nor perfectly transparent, but mixed from both, I infer from this, since the moon is of the same substance as the rest of its orb, it cannot be simply opaque, for the sky itself by its nature is transparent; and although transparency is not an essential accident of the sky itself, since it also belongs to other bodies, as inseparable from the sky itself, therefore if the moon consists of the same substance of the sky, however opaque it is, it will still have some transparency, which, even if it is not entirely permeable to light, will still admit some light, however obscure and doubtful, and so although the moon is not entirely permeable to the Sun's rays in some part of it, or not permeable at all, as it is according to the depth of the body, and in a large part of its surface, yet even according to these parts it has some transparency, and admits some light, at least according to some depth, since because of the vast thickness of the lunar body the Sun's rays, even though they are perpendicular, cannot penetrate its depth.",
      "Therefore, both from opacity and from thickness, in an eclipse of the Sun the lunar body, although it is placed perpendicularly under the Sun's rays, does not become permeable to them at all, but appears dark and shadowy, yet when it is illuminated by less than a sixth of the radiation, all that remains of the non-irradiated body seems to be suffused with a dark and ambiguous light; for it receives light from the oblique rays of the Sun only according to the superficial thickness; as much as the circumference of the lunar globe visible to us is, which is clearly seen to happen from this, for this light gradually diminishes as the Sun recedes more, and as the Sun's rays are received less obliquely until, having passed the first quarter, it finally disappears, with the Sun's rays illuminating more directly, and only illuminating"
