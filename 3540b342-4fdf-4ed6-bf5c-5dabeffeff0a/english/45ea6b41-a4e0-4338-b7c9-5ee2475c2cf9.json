      "From these, it can easily be established all that is questioned about light, and that which is ambiguous, and first, whether light is a substance, or an accident. For indeed, since light and illumination are perceptible by their nature, they cannot possibly be a substance, since a substance is hardly perceived by the senses except by reason of accidents, and since every substance is either simple or composite, neither light nor illumination can be either.",
      "For it is not simple, since it is divided into form and matter, and no one would say that matter is light, since it rather sustains the role of action than of potentiality, and of habit rather than of subject: nor less form, since form is inseparable from that of which it is the form, and does not admit of more and less, but light is separable from the transparent and illuminated body, of which it is said to be the action, without the corruption of the subject, and light in the luminous body admits of more and less, for we see bodies more and less luminous, even among the stars, therefore light and illumination are not a simple substance, nor indeed can they be a composite substance, since a composite substance is corporeal, but light and illumination cannot be a body, for if they were a corporeal substance, and a body, then they would not be in the air, nor in other transparent bodies, unless we say that a body is received in a body, which is least likely from the presumption of nature, nor does it solve the instance, that some say that light is a very thin body related to the celestial and divine, which by no means has operations far superior to these of ours, far more noble, therefore it is not moved in time, as our bodies hindered by this sluggish mass, but almost in an instant, and with an imperceptible delay of time, nor is it hindered by any thickness of body from permeating and pervading all things, which all attribute to light as to an immortal and uncreated body of that celestial sun, and its offspring, for all these things may be attributed to light on account of its perfection, and may agree with it, yet they can by no means effect, but if light is a body, it is not three-dimensionally measured, which however three-dimensionally measured is such, every other circumscribed quality, and condition, makes the sides diverge, therefore it cannot be received in a body, unless there is a vacuum in the body, which Aristotle in his Physics 4. demonstrated by the most certain reasons, and in the matter proposed it is most clear, for if light, or illumination were a body received and contained in the pores of the air, or in any transparent body, the air would become dark with the strongest winds expelling the luminous body from its pores, on the contrary the illuminated air would be denser and thicker because of the refracted other body of light, the contrary of which is demonstrated by experiment; nor do the arguments derived from the reflection and refraction of light support this opinion, for these are not properly said, but by a certain similarity, as we have explained more fully in the attached disputation on the phenomena in the lunar orb, in which we solved these very arguments, when we taught that the sky is not fiery, nor are the remaining arguments less weak, by which they strive to prove it, and first, that the ray is shaped by various figures according to the various figure of the places through which it passes (for passing through a square window it is shaped by a square figure, and through a round one it is completely round) is vain, since it is not the ray, or that produced light, but the air endowed with such light that is confirmed by this figure.",
      "The other indeed, that light itself, and the ray is moved from which it seems to be a body, is more easy, since light is not moved by itself, but changes place according to the movement of the luminous body, and its action is transmuted, namely illumination, which follows the presence of the luminous body in the transparent, just as we see light reflected from a shiny, and polished body to be moved according to the movement of the body from which it is reflected, and therefore light reflected from a trembling surface of water to be seen trembling in turn, and now here, now there to wander, as Virgil sang."

      "It is therefore established that light and illumination are not a substance, but an accident, and an accident since it is, either quantity, or quality, or relation, or where, or something else from the predicaments, and light or illumination is neither quantity, because then it would be something corporeal which we have already overturned, nor anything else from the other predicaments except quality, since the conditions and attributes of the other predicaments are by no means suitable for them: but what is of quality alone is attributed to them, for they are called habits by Aristotle, and perfectible of the transparent, they also denominate the subject, for from light the luminous is said, and from illumination the luminous, it necessarily follows that light is nothing else than a quality, and cannot be established and placed under any other genus, or category, than that of quality, although Scaliger resists, and thinks that it is contained under no predicament, for we place all things under some predicament, except God, who since he is the first being contains all things, and is contained by none, and since he is the most perfect, and absolute being, he is predicated of no other being, neither univocally, nor equivocally, and therefore we refer light, and illumination to quality, and properly to habit, and to that which is called species, and a constant form about each one, for Aristotle takes there accidental form, and form indeed is called light, and the act of the transparent, but insofar as it is transparent, and visible, but we call this quality real, and physical, not only light, about which there is no doubt, for this is in the luminous body perceptible by itself, and produced in the medium, it produces real effects, heat, and fire, and innumerable, by which the world is perfected, and adorned, but also illumination which we said is the image of light, for this although it is the reason of seeing, is also visible by itself, as we have shown above, and is colored by the colors of the transparent terminated, as is manifest in the colors more strongly moving the transparent moving, whose species is not received in the ray, but in the illuminated air by the second light or illumination, and the illumination itself seems to be infected by this color, and to color the rest in turn, and it in turn seems to infect and color the other bodies not only transparent, but also otherwise mixed with its brightness, as is clearly evident in these little stones, about which is the question, and we will demonstrate more clearly below.",
      "Nor do the instances of those who assert that light is only an intentional quality, since it is the reason of seeing, stand in the way, for intentional here is not taken, as it is distinguished against real, therefore nothing prevents light from being a real and intentional quality, as Scotus teaches best in the second of the Sentences, for every sign is a thing, but not every thing is a sign, nor even what they bring, if it were a real quality, then two lights would mix, and be confused in the medium, the contrary of which appears, for the light of a candle is not confused with the light of the Sun, or of another candle; to this indeed we say that the light of a candle, or of any fire is confused with the light of the Sun, or of any other more luminous, the indication is that the light of the stars is not seen in the day, and the light of a small candle is not conspicuous from afar at the light of a large torch.",
      "But it is true that light is not confused, for the light of a candle is not confused, and mixed with the light of a torch, unless the candle is mixed with the torch, and the light of a candle will be circumscribed in the air illuminated by the Sun, but this happens, because light is a splendor flowing from a luminous body, therefore if the luminous bodies are not mixed, neither can the light, which flows from them, be mixed, from which the flame of one candle will never be mixed with another, unless the candle is joined to the candle, although the light, that is the second light is mixed with another light produced by another light, nor does it follow more, what they say that an accident migrates from subject to subject, if light adhering to the luminous body; were communicated to the medium really, for this light is not the same in number with that which is of the luminous body, but its germ, and offspring;: and just as it does not follow, this absurdity, when the heat, which is congenital to fire is communicated to the air, so neither in the same way in light, in the same way, as heat is communicated to the air from fire; light is communicated to it from the luminous body, unless that heat finding in the subject a contrary quality, or equivalent to the contrary a medium in warmth, and is gradually introduced, but light finding no resistance of the contrary suddenly, and acutely.",
      "Therefore light in the body by itself luminous, for example in the Sun, and stars by their nature luminous is a habit, and a quality of the second kind, and it competes with them in the second way of learning by itself, (as the Peripatetics say) for it follows their essence, and inseparably competes with them, and therefore for the various essence of them, they shine in various ways, as we will demonstrate in the following chapter, but in the transparent, as light first produced, and the ray: is a quality flowing through a transient action, namely through illumination produced, which Philoponus wanted to signify in the second of the soul comment. 69. saying, that light is the operation of the transparent made by the effective, that is by the luminous body, which Aristotle also taught when he said that light is the presence of the luminous body in the transparent, but however as second produced as the image of the first light, or of the ray, and its species, so it is called the act of the transparent, as the transparent, and its kind of color.",
      "Therefore according to no signification of light, or illumination the light itself and what is called φως by the Greeks, will be able to be a substance, but only a quality although of all the most noble, and most excellent."
