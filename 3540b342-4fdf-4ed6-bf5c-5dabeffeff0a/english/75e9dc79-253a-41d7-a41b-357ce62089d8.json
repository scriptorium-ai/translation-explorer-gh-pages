      "I have proposed to conduct this discussion in a physical rather than mathematical manner, for the subject at hand is both physical and mathematical; for shape is an attribute of a continuum, as a continuum and a certain continuum's own nature are predetermined;",
      "However, mathematical consideration abstracts from a certain matter and subject, and therefore is more remote from our senses and from our innate way of knowing, which is from more concrete and connected, not to say in the peripatetic manner, composed and confused, but natural, and considers affections in matter and with motion, of which kind the things themselves first offer themselves to our senses and intellect, naturally, as I may say, and this discussion, taken up in a physical manner, will be more familiar and, like a telescope, this little eye-glass for all eyes; thus it will be suited to everyone's intellect.",
      "I also add, what may perhaps seem paradoxical, it will be more certain and contain less fallacy, for although mathematical demonstrations not only hold the first, but also the only degree of certainty; yet they obtain that certainty about a subject stripped of sensible conditions, as geometry about a continuum, as a continuum, and arithmetic about a discrete quantity; which considered in this way are necessary and unchangeable, and although mathematics sometimes descends to physical quantities, as in optics and harmonics, yet its contemplation is not affected by physical and natural quality, since it considers it only accidentally, as is clear to those who practice these disciplines theoretically and scientifically,",
      "not however practically and mechanically.",
      "Indeed, how much this hinders the understanding of natural things would be superfluous to show, since Aristotle has demonstrated this with many arguments against Plato, but I will only touch on the basis of those which contribute to the proposed discussion; namely, sensible forms and qualities, as things, cannot be separated from the subject without destruction and corruption, so they cannot be abstracted and separated by the mind without loss of truth, which I think is the cause of what is reported by philosophers and known by experience, namely, that the senses are deceived about common sensibles, namely motion, rest, number, size, and shape, which about their own, as color, or taste, either not at all, or very little are accustomed to be deceived.",
      "For since common sensibles are not passions of this or that certain and determined quantity, as proper sensibles must be, which follow certain dispositions, but happen as much as quantity is, and as its passions, hence it happens that the senses can indicate nothing certain or established about them, for the conception it forms about these with one proper sensible it finds to be true with another to be false;",
      "For from the color of an oar seen under water it judges it to be broken, which from the continuity of parts it knows by touch to be whole, and altogether as the senses are deceived about substances as about sensibles by accident, as when from the similarity of the nose and the curliness of the hair it thinks a Socrates similar to Socrates about those things which first adhere to the substance, and by which means proper sensibles happen to substances, it is easily deceived, as when it judges size both continuous and discrete, shape, motion, and rest, which adhere closely to the substance, and by which means the remaining affections happen to substances, as taste, color, sound, smell, and tangible qualities, therefore, and opinion about these can be both true and false, false if it conspires with the deceiving sense, and follows its judgment, as when the Epicurean thinks the sun is two feet, because he sees its size with his eyes, true however if it adheres to the judgment of rightly reasoning reason, and follows another more certain sense the deception of one sense the judgment of another sense more certain judging about the same common object, and reason following the more certain sense can correct and amend, as when the eye judges a stick under water to be broken, its deception the sense of touch can correct, or the same sense of sight about the same sensible differently however, and in another way disposed, as when the same sense of sight corrects and amends the deception about the stick existing under water, inspecting the same stick outside of water.",
      "Therefore, opinion about these sensibles can be both false and true, according as it follows the judgment of the deceiving or non-deceiving sense, or is corrected or abandoned by the aid of rightly reasoning reason, for since opinion is the lowest part of the rational soul, it can be joined to both sense and reason. Therefore, for this reason, as Aristotle has excellently shown, mathematics hinders natural speculations; for if it is a purely mathematical consideration, it abstracts from sensible and singular conditions, but if it follows the judgment of the senses, it is deceived, of which we have the most certain argument, for great illusions and deceptions occur in practical optics and harmonics, not indeed by reason of the organ or medium, but by reason of the object, as we easily see in painted pictures, which are from perspective, in which even with the proportional distance all eyes see the thing in another way than it is, for on a flat and entirely equal surface we see many roughnesses, prominences, depths, abysses.",
      "Therefore, to avoid this occasion of deception, I thought it safer to institute this discussion physically rather than mathematically and optically, but I say the occasion of deception not on the part of the organ and the telescope, as some have said, for this does not deceive as many indeed, and I among the rest, have most certainly known, since we saw the same thing exactly with no change made in the thing with the telescope, except only this: namely, that the thing which because of distance and length we scarcely knew at all, and indeed confusedly and obscurely, by the aid of the instrument we saw so distinctly and clearly, as if we were close to it, but by reason of the object, which cannot be seen otherwise not from distance, however long, but by reason of light and shadow, from whose varied mixture it is probable that these phenomena in the orb of the moon, about which we have instituted the discussion, appear."
