      "However, as many new things have been revealed and discovered through the benefit of this telescope, unknown to any mortal until now, namely, the planets, or wanderers around Jupiter, four in number, which the inventor rightly and deservedly named the Medicean Stars after his most noble patron, and Venus increasing and decreasing in light, and countless stars of the eighth sphere previously completely hidden and unseen by anyone, and the cause of the galaxy, or Milky Way, in the same sphere: One observation among others about the face of the Moon seemed to recall the spirits of the ancient philosophers and their opinions from the underworld after so many centuries (I say seemed), not to D. Galileo, whom I recognize as no less a philosopher than an outstanding mathematician, and therefore I have heard nothing definite or established from him about these so amazing and paradoxical matters, but perhaps to the common people, who think that false conclusions can be drawn from these observations, which he proposes for the philosophers and students of nature to observe, and the delusions of the ancients, which we will demonstrate more fully below.",
      "There are, however, the things that he observes in the Moon, first the unevenness of its surface, which antiquity called smooth and polished, and judged it to be one of the stars, and secondly a certain dark light seen in its globe as soon as it begins to be illuminated, and outlined even in its shadowy part in the darkness, but then fading as the light increases, so that it is more conspicuous and apparent when the Moon is less than a sixth, or a sixth, distant from the Sun in aspect; and the same when it is in a square aspect, and with the increasing light of the Sun it gradually weakens and withers.",
      "First, indeed, he proves by many observations, and very certain ones, and the first is, as soon as the Moon appears to us clearly illuminated, namely five days after conjunction, or when it has reached the first quarter, if its surface were smooth and even, then the shadowy and the bright would be separated by a smooth and even line, namely oval before the exact quarter, but straight in the quarter, according to the smooth and even surface; but on the contrary it appears from the telescope, for these lines are seen to be very uneven and sinuous; so that many bright protuberances extend beyond their proper limits into the dark part, and again many dark ones into the bright, therefore its surface is uneven.",
      "The second observation is from the illuminated parts of the Moon, for the illuminated parts of the Moon, until the Moon increases in light, are sprinkled with many and conspicuous spots, which appear blackish from the part facing the Sun more closely, and from the part opposite the Sun are crowned with almost glowing rays of brighter light, which is also an argument for the unevenness of the surface, since the higher parts are more illuminated by the opposite rays, and the lower parts less.",
      "Therefore, they also appear darker, as happens in this our earthly region, when the Sun has not yet risen above the horizon; for then the tops of the higher mountains are illuminated by the bursting rays of the Sun, and shine with light, while the lower places, and the valleys, are still shrouded in darkness, the third is from a certain cavity (to use Galileo's words) which we see in the middle of the Moon both when it is increasing and when it is decreasing to the quarter, which is surrounded by a perfect circular shape as if by very high ridges, he compares this shape to the land of Bohemia if it were surrounded by very high mountains in the shape of a perfect circle, the extreme edge of its circumference is observed to be illuminated by shadowy light before the boundary of light reaches the middle of the figure's diameter, therefore there is unevenness in this illuminated part, for if the surface of this circle were even, the half diameter of the circumference would be illuminated before the opposite circumference, now before the illumination reaches the half diameter, the opposite circumference is illuminated, therefore the circumference stands out far more than the diameter.",
      "The fourth, and strongest argument is, the appearance of certain spots of light in the shadow, which are far removed from the line separating the shadow and the light, and gradually increase with the approaching illumination, until at last they join with the bright part, and make various terminations to the shadow, which I said to be the strongest argument, since if the surface were smooth and globular, the parts would not begin to be illuminated from the opposite and distant shadow, until they were joined to the bright; but the light would extend into the shadow from the nearby illuminated body.",
      "He also observes in the illuminated part of the Moon, which appears brighter, I say which appears brighter, since in the illuminated Moon also some large darker spots are seen by all without a telescope, which since they have always been seen in the same way, are rightly called ancient, he observes (I say) in the brighter part of the Moon so many brighter spots distinguished by a darker circle, and rim, which part is seen facing the Sun, that he compares it to the eyes of a peacock's tail, or to crystal goblets filled with ice.",
      "I, seeing many very white stalks of grosbeak together and in a row, judge it to be similar to them, we also often see such white clouds dispersed by a thin wind, this when it seemed to be in the brighter part, the less bright parts, which we have called ancient spots, are seen differently, for they are not seen in the same way interrupted, nor filled with valleys, or mountains, but rather even, and uniform, they only abound here and there with some brighter spots, so much so, that if anyone wants to revive the old Pythagorean opinion, that the Moon is another Earth, its brighter part would more fittingly represent the surface of the earth, and the darker part the water.",
      "He asserts, however, that he never doubted that the surface of the terrestrial globe seen from afar, and bathed in the rays of the sun, would present a certain brighter surface, and the darker water would present itself to the view, nor does he observe these spots to be even, like the surface of water in the terrestrial globe, but also to be more prominent, as is gathered from the spot appearing in the northern part in the fourth description of figures; he also adds that it is clearly seen that the boundaries of these spots, by which they are distinguished from the shadowy part, are not rough, uneven, and sinuous, as are the bright parts, but rather smooth, even, and not interrupted by any roughness, from which it is confirmed, what was said above, that the surface of the large spots is completely smooth, and rather similar to the surface of water, than to the earth.",
      "He also observes in these spots some small areas, some of which are darker, which hardly change their darkness at all, as the solar rays more or less obliquely fall on them, they always make the same appearance, but some are brighter, indeed very bright, of which likewise always the same, and uniform is the appearance, no change being made of figures, or of darkness, or of light, which give a very certain indication, that the surface of these spots is smooth, and not rough, since the variety of the small areas is not seen, which certainly would be seen, if the surface were rough from the various illuminations of the sun casting various shadows.",
      "Therefore, he also asserts that it is clear that these varieties of the small areas appear rather from the heterogeneous nature of the body than from the unevenness of the surface.",
      "This is about the first observation: but the second observation of the light, by which the shadowy part of the Moon shines, he teaches to be made in this way, when the Moon is in a sextile aspect to the sun, or a little less, someone can with a telescope, or without, look at it in such a way through a narrow opening, that the illuminated crescent does not appear, and then, what remains of the dark orb of the Moon will be seen illuminated by a certain light, although blackish, and premature, so that even the dark remaining part of the surrounding sky will be seen by all outlined by its own, and proper magnitude.",
      "These observations we have learned not only from the Sidereal Messenger, but also from the very eyes of Galileo himself through the use of his telescope, which he proposed for all philosophers, and observers of the sky to contemplate, and investigate, there were not lacking those who, deceived by the similarity of speech, and homonymy, which he uses, interpreted him to be truly in this opinion, that he thinks there are mountains in the Moon similar to our stony, and earthy ones filled with large trees, or stripped of them, or valleys full of woods, and fruitful plains, or low ridges, and pleasant hills, which I know for certain he never even dreamed of; or perhaps they were deceived by the dissertation of the most learned Johannes Kepler addressed to him, in which it is certain that the man (otherwise serious, and grave) wished to joke, either for the sake of relaxing his mind, or to indulge the genius of the German nation, and of free liberty while he establishes new inhabitants in the Moon of gigantic figure, and they have dug for themselves a pit in the clayey earth of immense size (which he presents as the circles of an immense chasm seen near the middle of the Moon) to catch for themselves shade in the greatest heats of the day which are very long, namely about fifteen of our days, during which the Moon is continuously illuminated by the Sun, all of which, and I myself would gladly admit, if only the crypt were so large as to contain wine casks in the Italian manner, for which we rather dig underground cellars, and crypts for preserving wine, than for catching shade.",
      "But by what ship would Cretan, or Neapolitan wine be brought there, or even, if you like, Albanian, would it be fitted with wings, or sails, I leave this business to Kepler, for us the best is always at hand without difficulty, but I had forgotten, I had said there are pleasant wine-bearing hills there.",
      "Therefore there the vintage is more abundant, and plentiful, than in this our unhappy orb, and therefore the inhabitants have dug for themselves that very large wine cellar, the opening of which is so large, that it is seen by us as very vast.",
      "But we have joked enough already; lest perhaps someone from the common people gather this, or some similar opinion from these observations, I will briefly list all the opinions, both of the ancient, and also of the recent philosophers, to which these phenomena can be referred, and I will try to weigh them according to the calculation of the most known truth."
