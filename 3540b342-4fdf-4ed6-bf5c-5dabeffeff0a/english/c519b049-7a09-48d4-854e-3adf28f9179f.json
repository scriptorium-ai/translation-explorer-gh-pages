      "When many things shine in the darkness, which are not fiery, such as the lower belly of the glow-worm, or its tail, the heads and spines of fish, and scales, certain rotting woods, fungi; rotting waters, and the like, which are diverse, as we said from the beginning are of nature, when moreover some not only shine, but also emit so much light, as to illuminate the medium for vision like the eyes of a cat, which not only shine so as to be conspicuous, but also emit so much brilliance, that they themselves see, and hunt mice, which also happened to Tiberius Caesar, who woke up at night emitting so much light from his eyes, that he could see everything that was in the room, and also before Tiberius, Gaius Marius who deterred the soldiers sent to kill him with the glare from his eyes;",
      "But since the particular cause of each of these cannot be assigned, I think all these things should be referred to one common and adequate cause, namely to that which we have assigned above, namely the participation of that substance which is luminous in itself, ethereal and celestial, which we have said above, on the authority of Aristotle, is diffused through all things; or fiery, in which we have previously demonstrated that much of that luminous substance is contained, or by reason of both, but since we have said above that this substance is diffused through all bodies, as if they were endowed with that celestial faculty, by which all things are preserved in their being, why do not all things shine?",
      "To this postulation we say that the power and faculty of this celestial substance is not one, but multiple in potential, which becomes apparent in various bodies in various and multiple ways, through motion and light, so that it imparts heat to some, and not light, which are by nature earthy, and participate minimally in the ethereal and transparent body, to others however light, and not heat, which have much of that transparent and celestial spirit, such as we see all the above mentioned things to be, yes, and in the belly of the glow-worm, which shines, there is a very clear liquid, and this is filled with much of this ethereal spirit, it is a sign that it disappears when they die, although it is preserved for some time since insects are animals, and in the scales, and heads, and spines of fish such a lot of liquid is seen, pearls are a sign of this which are very shiny, and are also referred to the nature of fish bones, nor does the glow in the heads, or scales of fish, or such like last for long, but eventually disappears when that shining spirit is dissipated, in rotting things however such a lot of body is collected on the surface; separated, and drawn to the circumference by the innate heat from that which is surrounding; but it shines most in those bodies, in which there is a lot of transparent liquid, as is evident in rotting waters, or those containing much air, as in rotting beech, elm, fig woods, which contain much air in themselves, which is why the rotting thing, which is in them, shines in the darkness, and appears very white in the light.",
      "But the light, which is conspicuous in the eyes of some at night, and emits light, is also to be referred to the same cause, for a great quantity of shining spirits is transmitted to the eyes, from which it happens, that they are sent to the eyes alone by the perforated and open nerves, but these spirits, since they are fiery, and shining, illuminate the crystalline and white humor, from which it happens, that not only do the eyes shine, but they also see in the darkness, but this not only refers to the quantity of shining spirits, but also to the size of the pupil, and the clarity and brightness of the humor.",
      "Porta in his booklet entitled, why we see one thing with two eyes proposition three. ",
      "For animals of this kind, which have shining eyes and see at night are endowed with very wide pupils, and have very clear aqueous and crystalline humors, such are cats, owls, and other nocturnal creatures. Therefore, he thinks that these things are seen inside, not outside, which is true, however it is necessary that the visual spirits first illuminated the humors of the eyes with their clarity; otherwise vision could not take place, since vision takes place without light; or pre-existing in the eye; as when colors are seen; or vibrated by the thing seen, as when shiny things are seen.",
      "This opinion attributed to the ancients, and to Plato, although I know that Aristotle refuted it in his book on sense, and sensible, where he assigns another cause; to that light, which we see flashing from our compressed eyes; to that also, which shines at night, and in the darkness in the aforementioned bodies, however I consider it true, nor do I contradict Aristotle, for Aristotle there refuted the apparent opinion of the ancients, as is often his custom, therefore, he brings in the verses of Empedocles, in which he asserts that fire is enclosed in the eye wrapped in many transparent membranes like in a lantern lit at night, so Empedocles sang,"

      "From these words, if they are understood literally, it seems that our fire, and the elementary eye, is enclosed, which can be extinguished by the injury of the winds or rains; but this is not that celestial and vital fire, which the spirit retains a great part of; this is inextinguishable and immortal, and that Aristotle attacked this sense there, is clear from the instances he brings, for he says against Timaeus that this light cannot be extinguished in the darkness, since extinction is of the hot and dry by the cold and wet, but there is no dryness and heat in the light that can be extinguished, it appears; and again, if this could be done, then also in the day, neither water nor ice would be seen, if indeed in these as contrary the fire would be extinguished.",
      "Therefore, for this reason, I think Aristotle spoke against the ancients, and also to show that the organ of sight is watery as it really is, not fiery.",
      "But someone will say, that instance, which Aristotle first brings, is not solved, for if the spirits of light were contained in the eyes, then it would be allowed for all to see in the darkness, which is not the case, to which we respond, as above with the most learned John Baptist Porta we noted, not only, to see in the darkness, is a supply of the spirit of light required; but also the width of the pupil, and the transparency and clarity of the aqueous humor, and if any of these is lacking, vision cannot occur in the darkness, from which it happens, that however great the supply of the visual spirit may be, if however the spirits are not clear and bright, but thick and cloudy, they are unfit for seeing.",
      "And although there is a supply of the spirit of light, yet the pupil is narrow, so that the spirit is not copiously and abundantly poured out, there is no vision in the darkness: but if both have been required, but the aqueous humor is not clear and transparent, nor can such vision occur in the darkness, but a kindred light diffused in the middle is required, by which the aqueous and crystalline humors are illuminated, and thus by both lights as it were mixed together vision is effected, which opinion Plato expressed in these words in Timaeus. [Therefore, when the light of day has come to the outflow of the eye, then like is joined and united to like, and from this a certain proper and kindred body is formed for the direct gaze of the eyes.]",
      "And Galen followed in book 7. of Hippocrates and Plato's decrees c.6. Therefore, since so many conditions are required at once, that someone may be able to see in the darkness, and it is rare for all to be found at once, it is not surprising if not all see in the darkness, however all have these clear visual spirits: however, some, to whom all these conditions are, such as it is known Tiberius Caesar was, see in the darkness, Porta affirms that this often happened to him.",
      "And I, having been allotted such a structure of the eyes, having been awakened after a very short delay of time, have sometimes managed to see in the darkness, and I see at night, and in the darkness, so that I walk with an unoffended foot without any light; Alexander established this doctrine in problem 68. where he gives the cause of this question, and says most animals can see during the day, they cannot at night, because they have a thicker visual spirit, which can penetrate the air to the thing to be seen: it thickens at night when it cools with the absence of the sun, it thins during the day with the benefit of the air, which is thin and hot.",
      "However, cats, and hyenas, and bats behave the opposite, since they see nothing or little during the day, they see everything sharply at night, they indeed have that visual spirit, and very thin, and very clear, so that at night this moderately thickening is suitable for the sight of things by the lack of light, it is spread out and vanishes above measure, which is why lions also do not tolerate the sun entering more actively, they have a rather sharp sight of the eyes, and they avoid the sun during the day for this reason.",
      "It is known that the sight of the lion is such by the argument of the pupil, which shines brightly, and also of the moist part of the eyes, which is very clear, and in problem 69. where he says, Why when we suddenly open our eyes during the night while sleeping we perceive light; because the spirit of seeing being forced and enlarged in sleep; the whole bursts forth in a large supply through the darkness, and shines; and so it can rightly be seen with a certain appearance of light.",
      "Nor does it therefore follow from this sentence that vision is made by sending out, and consequently in time; not necessary is it for the visual rays by their substance, and corporeal mass to be extended to the thing seen, but by so much light, and spiritual quality whose production neither is made by motion, nor in time.",
      "Necessary however is such a production of light, that vision is made by sending in, not out, nor in the middle, and by the clear parts of the eye being illuminated, and this indeed I think is the cause of those things, which shine at night, the supply, that is of that ethereal spirit, which is diffused through all things in a clear, and transparent body, such as is watery, or airy, enclosed, or by the mixture of a fiery portion; since in fire there is very much of this ethereal, and celestial spirit in being it has been demonstrated, next after fire to air.",
      "But someone will say if fire were further in these, then they would be seen to burn, which does not happen, to which instance we respond with Plotinus in book 1. of the Enneads 2. paragraph 6. a little after the middle.",
      "Indeed many can be communicated with light from fire without heat, which Plotinus said are colored by the fire itself, such as are, many cold, and bright things, these however are Plotinus's words.",
      "[But indeed it is not at all necessary for fire to be in the earth, it is enough for light, if indeed snow, and very cold things are bright without fire, although someone may have said there was fire there, and it colored those things before it left.]",
      "But by a very clear example are lime, which when it has already boiled, and even extinguished by the force of fire remains very white, so that even at night its whiteness is conspicuous; and coruscations, in which no impression of heat is made, the air is only colored by the fire, nor does the authority of Aristotle hinder me in the aforementioned book on sense, and sensible, where he assigns another cause of this effect, namely the lightness of the surface; from which light, however small bounces back, and becomes conspicuous, so however he says.",
      "The cause of this and of doubting, and of thinking fire to be seen; is to be taken from here; for light things are born to shine in the darkness, but not to make light, however the eye being black, and the middle, light appears, and this appears when the eye is moved, because it happens as if two become one, and this the speed of motion makes, so that it seems to be another thing seen and seen, therefore it does not happen unless quickly, and in the darkness this happens, light is born to shine in the darkness, like the heads of certain fish, and cuttlefish ink, Aristotle in this place does not reveal the cause of those things which shine of themselves, but of those which when they receive light from another, however they reflect a greater, and conspicuous light, so that it shines in the darkness; such are those things, which have a light, and polished surface, such as are, those which Aristotle refers to here, such also are polished gems, and of these the hardest, like the diamond from which we see light however small enough brightly reflected; and especially if it is moved, these however if they receive no light from elsewhere, in no way shine, therefore neither the diamond, nor other such gems in a completely dark room, with no light admitted, will shine, nor therefore are these bright of themselves.",
      "Aristotle speaks of these things, and brings their cause, not of those which shine of themselves, such as are those, the reason of which we here try to assign, which shine in pure darkness with no light admitted, like glow-worms, rotting wood, heads, and scales, and spines of fish, pebbles, about which a problem is proposed, and other things of this kind, which all in a room with the windows exactly closed, and all holes, so that no light at all can be admitted, still shine very brightly.",
      "These things being supposed, and these things, which shine in the darkness, being declared, which all we have referred to one common cause, namely, as we have often said, to that ethereal and bright substance enclosed in a transparent airy, or fiery body, I come to solve the proposed problem, and first I will recount the nature, and condition of the stone.",
      "This is a stone, which is found in the field of Bologna, it is split, and somewhat transparent, so that it seems similar to talc, it is of an arsenical nature, and very hot, and caustic, therefore some circulators use it to sharply eradicate or scrape off hairs, as bath attendants use in hypocausts gold pigment and lime, such is its nature this stone, which thus prepared does not shine, but that it may conceive light, and having conceived retain it for some delay of time, and reflect it, as we said at the beginning we saw, it is necessary for it to be calcined, or artificially burned by fire, so that it is turned into lime; and thus according to that part, which is turned into lime, it conceives light, and shines, when according to the remaining part it does not shine, it conceives light only from the Sun, as I have experienced, and have received from others, nor is it necessary for it to be exposed to the rays of the sun, or to primary light, but it is enough for it to be exposed to light, or to secondary light, from which the light of twilight is enough: the light, which it reflects, is reddish, and similar to glowing coals, the light does not last longer, but gradually weakens, and vanishes; as, nor does this power of the stone of receiving, and reflecting light always last, but is lost with the passage of time, as I have experienced in the stone, which the most learned Marcus Antonius Prosper from Paliano, a very careful investigator of the secrets of nature, showed me, from all of which things narrated before I think the cause of light in this stone to be the same, which is in the other things shining at night, of which we have spoken, namely a great supply of a fiery and shining substance enclosed in a white material.",
      "But that there is much in this stone of such a substance of this kind, is first gathered from its very hot, and fiery nature, and power, since it is an arsenical stone, and caustic.",
      "But when this fire is enclosed in a thicker moisture, sticky, and smooth, it shines only, but does not shine; while the stone is not burned, and turned into lime, but when it is burned, with that thicker moisture consumed it becomes white, and whitish, and with the more purified remaining part, that fiery part acquires greater clarity from the light of the fire, as Plotinus was saying, in some way colored; and since all white things not only have much light, but also are very apt to receive, and retain it, hence it happens, that this stone turned into lime, and made very white exposed to light is kindled with greater light; because however this light is greater, than that which is accustomed to flow from white things, for white things, like fresh lime, and snow are indeed conspicuous in some way at night, and have a certain brightness, but not splendor, and indeed these are not seen at all without light: but require some light however small, and doubtful, as the light of the stars is at night.",
      "But this stone, both shines, and shines in pure darkness, therefore it is not to be thought that only from the whiteness of the calcined part, which receives and retains light so much light comes, but most of all it comes from that very thin and transparent fiery substance enclosed in the pores of the calcined part, both from the nature of the stone very hot, and fiery, and also from the action of the preceding fire, which substance being akin to light, and related, is easily colored by the meeting light: nor indeed should it move us, that this stone does not burn, but fire however does not shine without burning, for many things are, which have only light from fire, not heat, like all white things, which are only colored by fire, they do not get hot, as we have proved from Plotinus above, and it is clear in coruscations in fool's fire, and in the light of beaver, which appears to sailors in a storm, and in that fire, which seemed to sit on the head of many without the hairs being touched, which Livy narrates happened to Servius Tullius, in all of which light, and brightness is seen without heat, which is also conspicuous in alcohol, and camphor because of the thinness of the parts, although these also burn, and are very thin flame, therefore I think the least true is Cardano's science, who in the book on gems and colors says, that those things, which shine in the night, are seen under the color of fire, because when they are white, in the middle of the darkness, which are black, they are seen.",
      "But the color of fire, which is also reddish, is from black and white as if equally mixed.",
      "For if this were true, all white things would be seen under the appearance of fire in the darkness, which experience shows to be false, for neither snow, nor lime, nor gypsum nor anything else however white reflect the appearance of fire in the darkness, although they are conspicuous in some way, as we have said, indeed this same stone, about which, is the conversation after that thin fire substance, which had been enclosed has vanished, although it keeps and retains the same whiteness in that calcined part, however it emits no brightness: by a very certain indication this does not come from whiteness only, as Cardanus thought, but this brightness immediately flows from that thin substance, and not from elsewhere: which also from this is clearly established, for both the conceived light gradually vanishes, and this bright power of the stone also itself is dissipated, as we said, and does not last for a long time; but that it is kindled only by the light of the Sun, and not by another, I think this to be the cause, that the light of the Sun is most effective, since it remains from the first light, but light or second light is enough, because it is most apt of all to receive and reflect colors, from which it easily colors, and is colored, it is clear from this in colors, which when they are illuminated by the first light, and root, however their species is received in the second light, and is reflected by the same, indeed not only the species of colors, but also images, and idols are most clearly reflected, if it has been sent into a dark place through a narrow hole, and is received in a smooth body.",
      "Let these things be said about the proposed problem, which will yield to better discoveries, and will fall silent."
