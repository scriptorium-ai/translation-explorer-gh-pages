      "In the order we shall proceed, first indeed the experiments, and as I may say, observations made by Mr. Galileo in the sphere of the Moon, a most faithful account, as extracted in the booklet, named the Starry Messenger, and shown to the most illustrious Federico Cesi, Marquis of Monticelli, a most learned man, and primarily, as of nobility, so of literature, and to me, and many other learned men, the most learned Galileo with his telescope on many occasions, and most certainly showed, I will bring forth and propose, then indeed about the certainty of the telescope instrument, and the correct way of seeing through it which, both to me, and to all have been found out without deception, I will report, and I will try to confirm its certainty with reasons, against those who think otherwise;",
      "Thirdly, the opinions of the philosophers, to which these phenomena can be referred, and are referred by the most learned Kepler, the mathematician of the Imperial Majesty in his dissertation with the Starry Messenger, I will list individually, and examine.",
      "Fourthly, and lastly, what seems to me to be more likely to be said about all these things, I will explain, and I will try to refer these phenomena from the opinions of Peripatetic philosophy, to certain causes."
