      "For all the Eclipses, which Ptolemy records in the years of Nabonassar, and the days of the Egyptian months, prove this.",
      "For example, the total Lunar Eclipse, which in book 4. Almag. cap.6. he reports to have occurred in the year I. Mardocempadi, & 27. Nabonassar, on the 29th day of the month Thot, following the 30th, around the first hour after its rise, cannot, with the Astronomical canons intact, have occurred, except on the 25th day of February, in the year 721. before the Epoch of Christ:",
      "Therefore, the year I. Nabonassar was 747. before the usual Epoch of Christ.",
      "Moreover, Censorinus in his book on birthdays, chapter 8, asserts that in the Julian year 283, when he was writing that book, which is accepted by the highest Chronologists as an oracle, began before the VI. Kal. Jul. namely at noon on the 25th of June, the year of Nabonassar 986. & the Egyptian year of Nabonassar 886. began a hundred years earlier, that is in the Julian year 183. before XII. Kal. Aug. namely at noon on the 20th of July.",
      "Therefore, in the Julian year 46, which is known from the said pro. I. foundation to coincide with the first Epoch of Christ, the year of Nabonassar 749. began on the 23rd of August, for before that the year 748. was running.",
      "Furthermore, in the canon expanded by single years, keeping the quantity of the Egyptian year, which is precisely 365 days, going back, we arrive at the year 747. before the Epoch of Christ, and the 26th day of February, from whose noon began the year I. Nabonassar, in which indeed in the regression within the year before the Epoch of Christ 521. as it happens in a Leap year, two years of Nabonassar begin, namely the year 227. on the 1st of January, & the Year 228. on the 31st of December, which was worth noting."
