      "For Ptolemy in I.3.c.2. of the Great Construction clearly affirms that the years begin from the death of Alexander, from the first midday of the first Egyptian month of Thoth, just as the years of Nabonassar: which Censorinus himself asserts in chapter 8. Then Ptolemy adds, from the beginning of Nabonassar to the death of Alexander, 424 years had passed. And Censorinus in the said chapter 8, says that with the year of Nabonassar 986, the year of Alexander 562 began. Therefore, the first of Alexander began with the year of Nabonassar 425, immediately after the completion of 424. Now indeed from the said for 2, the foundation, the first of Nabonassar began in the year 747 before the Epoch of Christ, therefore if you subtract 424 years from 747 years, there remain 323 years before Christ, completed, before the beginning of which the first of Alexander had begun on the 12th of November with the year of Nabonassar 425."

      "To this, not only Arrian in book 7 and Diodorus Siculus in book 17, but, as Josephus says in book 1 against Apion, all historians affirm that Alexander the Great died εν αρχη της εχτοςη, χαι τεσσαρης, χαι δεχατης Ολυμπιαδος at the beginning of the 114th Olympiad, therefore 113 Olympiads, that is 452 years, were completed, which if you subtract from the years before Christ 776, with which from the said foundation 3, the Olympiads began, there will be left the Year before the Epoch of Christ 324, in which the 112th Olympiad began, and Alexander the Great died.",
      "Let the Epoch of Alexander not have begun immediately from his death, but from the beginning of the Egyptian year 425, on the 12th of November, around which time Philip Ariadaeus began to rule in his place."
