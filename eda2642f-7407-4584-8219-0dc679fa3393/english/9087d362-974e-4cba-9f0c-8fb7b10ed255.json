      "From the Consular Fasti, which, by the consensus of all chronologists, run in a certain and uncorrupted order from the first Julian year to Trajan, it is clear that in the Julian year 90, the consuls were M. Vinicius and Statilius Corvinus; and that during their consulship, a solar eclipse occurred in Rome on the birthday of Emperor Claudius, namely on the Kalends of August, as Dio and Suetonius attest.",
      "But a solar eclipse on the Kalends of August in Rome around that time, no astronomical tables or laws can show in any other year than 45 of the usual Christian era.",
      "Now subtract 45 from 90 years, there remain 45 Julian years completed before the first year of the Christian era, and therefore the first year of this era began with the 46th Julian, and the year of the Christian era 238 with the Julian 283, in which year, as we will soon say, Censorinus was writing his golden book about the birthday.",
      "We have shown the same thing with several other eclipses found in historians in our Chronol. Refor., but this single one should suffice for now."
