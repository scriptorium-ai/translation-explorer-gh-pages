      "I came to you, Mercury, with two letters recently published on the subject of Astronomy, to hear your thoughts on them, for I am greatly refreshed by our conversations. One is from Riccioli, the other from Cassini, which I present to you here; have you seen and read their content?"

      "Mercury. They have already reached me, and I read in them the controversy that arose on the occasion of the publication of Francesco Leuera's Prodromus, as if it was long expected to stir up a dispute between Uranometrists and Astronomers who care to maintain their observations and documents, which they have committed to print: and the content of Riccioli's and Cassini's letters primarily revolves around the abundance of tools and instruments they possess for observing, far superior to all those that Tycho had, and therefore they claim to have far greater faith in their observations than in Tycho's observations, and consequently more than in the doctrine derived from Tycho's observations."

      "Sau. I too have seen in Cassini's book of observations from Bologna for the years 1655 and 1656, page 12, him rebuking Tycho for describing the equinoxes as they should have been observed, rather than as they were actually observed, and I also read on page 15 of the same book a correction made by Cassini himself to the equinox of Spring observed by Tycho in the year 1584 in Uraniborg at 21:30 p.m., that is, at 15:30 of the day, by comparing it with the observation of the equinox of Spring of the year 1656 made by Cassini himself with the great Gnomon in Bologna at 9:50 p.m., that is, at 3:50 of the night, by which he asserts that the equinox of Spring of the year 1584 was in Uraniborg at 23:6 p.m. and not at 21:30 p.m. as Tycho himself observed."

      "Merc. Learned men, who are not ignorant, whether observations of the Sun made at night (which are truly not observations, but calculations) can be more accurate than observations of the Sun made during the day, which are real and true observations; likewise they will not be able to ignore how much a correction of the observation of the Sun made by Tycho during the day, by an observation of the Sun made at night by Cassini himself, is worth."

      "Sau. Indeed, it is of great importance to Riccioli and Cassini that the name and authority of Ptolemy and Tycho, and their observations and traditions, decrease in the literary Republic. Have you seen on the frontispiece of the new Almagest edited by Riccioli, Ptolemy lying down, and the inscription above him, \"I rise as I am corrected.\" But the provincials have taken on a great task, because the Principality of Astronomy has been transferred from Ptolemy to Tycho, and the fame and glory of their observations and traditions, and their doctrine, which has been widely spread throughout the world, has taken such deep roots, that the four observations of Riccioli gathered together from the year 1643 to the year 1647, and the two observations of Cassini from the year 1655 to the year 1656, on which they wanted to base a new Astronomy different from the Astronomy of Ptolemy and Tycho and all others, can never be of any value against the far more numerous and skilled observations of Ptolemy and Tycho, and their resulting Astronomical doctrine: For the literary Republic of the whole world fully knows that Ptolemy has been known by many for centuries, and is well aware of the most expensive equipment of instruments and organs made by Tycho, and his incomparable experience in observing celestial motions, never interrupted, but always growing, acquired by him over a period of 30 years, namely from the year 1570 to the year 160, and that before his observations and tables of motions were published; and not only does it see many observations of the Sun's entrances at the points of the Equinoxes and Solstices, but also countless observations of the same Sun through almost all parts of the Zodiac, and it knows what the heirs of Tycho testify in a letter to Rudolph II Emperor at the beginning of the book Progymn. namely that no King or Prince after Alfonso the King has made so many and such great expenses in Astronomy, if indeed not only all that he could gather from the fiefs and benefits, which he had most generously from the illustrious King of the Danes Frederick for the splendor of his lineage and his love of Astronomy, but also more than a hundred thousand thalers from his own pocket he has spent on these studies: For he used from the year 1570 for the scrupulous observations of the Sun a large Quadrant showing each minute, which he had made in 1569 in Augsburg, with Paul Heinzell as consul there, which Quadrant was of such a size that it could hardly be carried by 20 strong men from the place where it was made to the nearest hill, where it was to be set up, as is read in the Progymn. of Tycho, pages 353 to 356. He also used the services of at least ten skilled observers, even in different places in Europe, with the help and expense of Frederick II, King of Denmark. He also then used a sextant, which he had made in place of an astronomical radius, about which he speaks at length in the said book I. Progymn. from page 335. And among other instruments for scrupulously investigating the altitudes of the Sun and Stars, he had ten different forms and sizes of instruments made with the utmost perfection, with labor, diligence, and inestimable expense, as Tycho himself affirms in the said book of Progymnasmatum on page 15 And he had these instruments made after he was noticeably deceived by other finely crafted instruments in about four minutes regarding the Sun's elevation at both Solstices, and regarding the altitude of the Pole Star both at its maximum and minimum. Just as he affirms that he investigated these points of the Equinoxes on page 14 of the same book Progymn. from the evening by means of variously crafted instruments of great size, and solidity of metallic material, and exact arrangement of divisions and small pins, so carefully crafted that they would not make him doubt even a third, a fourth, or in some cases even a sixth part of a minute; without which precision this subtle business is attempted in vain, for one minute of variation in altitude, and therefore also in the declination of the Sun near the equinoxes, where the daily change of declination is greatest, changes the longitude of the Sun by two and a half minutes, which make up almost a full hour: And he recounts the same from page 68, protesting that not one astronomical instrument should be relied upon in this subtle investigation, but several should be used, and labor and expense should not be spared."

      "Sau. Did you notice in Riccioli's letter, not a word about refractions?"
    ],
    [
      "Merc. Riccioli prudently kept silent in his aforementioned letter to Cassini about the necessary requirements in observations, and principally Refractions, for he knows very well that the whole knot of this controversy lies in the refractions, which are caused by vapors in the air, and that without knowledge and practice of Refractions, the true longitude of the Sun and Stars, nor the true magnitude of the Sun's diameter in any distance of the Sun from the Apogee and Perigee, nor in any position of the Sun on the horizon, from which vapors, through which Refractions occur, not only sensibly raise the planets and stars, but also make the diameter and disc of the Sun and Stars larger, as is admitted by all Opticians and Astronomers. Riccioli also kept silent about Refractions, because he could not prove with Cassini's note that Refractions are the same everywhere on earth, as Cassini proclaimed in the latest Ephemerides of Lansberg, the excellent Marquis of Malvasia; because among all Opticians and Astronomers, and according to Riccioli himself in book 3. Almag. of his cap. 9. page 115. & cap. 10. page 120. it is undoubted that refractions are very different everywhere on earth, not only in all horizons of the earth, but also in any horizon they vary according to the four seasons of the year, and also according to the parts of each day, as Leuera also reports in his Prod. cap. 3. page 127. & in cap. 8. page 198. & Tycho in Progymn. page 141. & 145. Nor could he testify about any knowledge and practice of Cassini regarding refractions, since in Cassini no experience of the refractions due to observations made by the Gnomon in the horizon of Bologna could have preceded, because in the same year 1655, in which the said Gnomon was reformed in the middle of June, he observed the autumnal equinox, and in the year 1656 the spring equinox, although he truly did not observe this equinox, but calculated it, because it was at night, as we said, and he immediately published both observations, and all the more so, because he confessed himself to be doubtful and uncertain about the refraction due at an altitude of the Sun of 45 degrees, as is read in his booklet of observations of the years 1655 and 1656 page 18."
    ],
    [
      "Moreover, Riccioli kept silent, because he could not prove that he had achieved a complete practice and experience of refractions also in the horizon of Bologna due to any altitude of the Sun above the aforementioned horizon, nor to any position of the Sun under the Zodiac, nor the apparent magnitude of the Solar diameter, sometimes larger, sometimes smaller, both because of the most irregular vapors, and because of its distance from the Apogee. First, because he admits in the said cap.10.lib.3 page 116. that it is clearly impossible, or very difficult, to define the apparent diameter of the Sun without an error of one minute of the first degree: For all methods, he adds there on page 117. for investigating the Sun's diameter with any instruments, namely quadrants, armillary spheres, and the Gnomon, assume that the edges of the luminaries, or the boundaries of light and shadow, can be precisely discerned and touched, without any sensible error being perceived, without any sensible part being included; which will be found to be hardly, or not even hardly, possible by anyone who wants to try."
    ],
    [
      "Sau. And especially where the Sun appears elliptical, as through the hole of the said Gnomon because of its imperfect elliptical shape, and narrower at the bottom, as he says in lib.10. Almag. of his page 653. concluding in the said lib. 3. cap.10. page 120. that he will discuss the magnitude of the Solar diameter individually in the optical book sect. de refract. which book has not yet been published by him."
    ],
    [
      "Merc. Second, because as he states in the preface to his Almagest page 18. & in Cronicon page 37. after he turned to the observation of celestial motions, which was around the year of Christ 1643, when he had previously exercised the magisterium and chair of Philosophy and Theology for 16 years, he began to print in the year 1648. the said Almagest of his with four Solar observations made by him in the years 1643. & 1646. & 1647. but that of 1646 was calculated, because it was at night; and he completed the edition of the same Almagest in the year 1651. Nor did he publish with his observations of the Equinoxes and the Summer Solstice, any preceding observations of refractions in the horizon of Bologna made by him, by the experience and practice of which he could prove, and not affirm by words, but by deeds, that he rightly and correctly observed the exact time of the said autumnal, spring, and summer equinoxes: For that table of refractions, which he exhibits at the end of the whole of his said Almagest, namely in book 10. on the last page 668. deserves no faith: For after he rejoices on page 654. of the same book 10. that he found the same refractions in the summer solstice in Bologna as those which Tycho found in Denmark; Shortly afterwards on page 667. forgetting this joy and agreement, he dares to correct enormously the long labored table of Tycho's refractions long observed by him in Denmark, and it is very different from his Bolognese one, without him ever having gone to Denmark, this corrector Riccioli, and observed refractions there for a longer time than Tycho.",
      "Sau. These overly ambitious attempts take away all credibility from their tables and corrections, because it is now clear to the literary republic that Riccioli could not have acquired the necessary expertise and practice of refractions in the Bolognese horizon before the aforementioned observations of the equinoxes were published by him, let alone correct the refractions that occur most irregularly in other horizons, due to this almost incomprehensible doctrine and expertise of refractions, which is not acquired in two or four years with a few observations, but hardly with great, long-lasting labor of numerous observations and a variety of instruments after many years of experience and practice:",
      "Just as Tycho is known to have achieved this in the Uraniburg horizon with great labor and almost countless observations over 30 years. In book 1. Progymn. page 15. & 16. where among other things he had ten instruments constructed, he made another armillary instrument, whose diameter was ten feet, with which he could investigate the amount of solar refractions in the winter solstice, which he could not investigate with many other instruments, as he investigated after several years of continuous experience, as is read on page 79. dd. Progymn. Just as he also observed the refractions due to fixed stars after many previous observations of several years, as in the same Progymn. page 56. & page 280. However, the multitude of observations for investigating the appropriate refractions individually around the equinoxes and solstices was revealed to the literary republic by Albertus Curtius, who had all of Tycho's observations published by order of Emperor Ferdinand III. For around the summer solstice of the year 1589. namely from the 11th of June to the 17th, in the Julian calendar, namely in the space of six days, he found that Tycho had made eighty observations of refractions before and after noon, as Riccioli also admits in book 10. Almage. his page 655. Moreover, it is clear how much labor and time, and a very accurate balance, Tycho investigated the apparent magnitude of the Sun's diameter in the Uraniburg horizon, and in the Apogee, and Perigee, and intermediate distances, as is read in Progymn. page 471. & Kepler testifies in Astronomia optica page 941. & Leuera reports in chapter 8. of his Prodr. page 195."
    ],
    [
      "Merc. Therefore, if Riccioli and Cassinus had had the experience and complete practice of the appropriate refractions for any altitude and longitude of the Sun observed by their instruments in the Bologna horizon, and also the magnitude appropriate to the solar diameter in any elevation of the Sun in that place, both in the horizontal Bologna and from the Apogee to the Perigee, and from the Perigee to the Apogee there;",
      "Such experience in this subtle business, and especially the entrances of the Sun into the points of the Equinoxes and Solstices, is greatly required, which can only be acquired by many years of frequent and long-lasting observations, as has been said; and that experience, practice, and expertise of refractions, and of the Sun's diameter, would have been had by Cassinus. & Riccioli preceding the observations of the Equinoxes given by them into the light, just as Tycho had in his horizon through countless observations well known to the literary republic: the difference between the observations of the true Equinoxes published by them and those of Tycho would have been very small, just as the difference between the autumnal Equinoxes and the summer Solstice is small, from those of Tycho, where smaller refractions occur, than at the time of Spring raising the Sun more than is right, and making the same Sun larger than it really is, as is clear in the comparisons of those Autumnal ones made by Riccioli by Leuera with those of Tycho in chapter 3. of his Prod. page 117. & in chapter 13. page 297. But there would be almost no difference, even if he had used the usual parallaxes, as Leuera said above in d. chapter 3. from page 119. For it does not seem to be enough for the literary republic, which loves only truth, that Riccioli is ready to contend with any pledge that the parallax of the Sun is less than one minute, or certainly not above; but it is necessary to prove what he intends, nor is it enough to allege that he and Cassinus have made more observations of refractions, and parallaxes, and of the Sun's diameter, but it is necessary to bring them into the middle, to produce and exhibit them, so that they may be under the judge, both as to their manner and time, and as to their perfection.",
      "For who would agree to the reform of old astronomy, and the foundation of a new one from only two or four observations gathered in the space of two or five years, and hastily published, and with many necessary instruments for observing hardly made, or not yet finished, or tested, and with the mass of refractions completely undigested?"
    ],
    [
      "Sau. Indeed, the practice and art of rightly and correctly observing and measuring celestial motions is not acquired in a few years, as it seems, for Tycho, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the eccentricity of the Sun, the magnitude of the year, the tables of mean motions, and of the Apogee, and of the equations, and declinations of the Sun, and their epochs, and roots, did not bring to light, nor did he define the catalog of fixed stars, except after having acquired and left to posterity the expertise of refractions, in which he surpassed all astronomers, and was rightly called the first measurer of refractions, and not except after countless observations, both of refractions and of motions over a period of thirty years, as the father running through the book Progymn. of Tycho.",
      "Indeed, he did not even give all the aforementioned things to light while he was alive, as is read at the beginning of the same Progymn. But his heirs published them;",
      "For that book was a posthumous work, for the Progymnasmata printed in Uraniburg, Denmark, were completed in Prague, Bohemia, in the year 1602 after the death of Tycho himself, and the Ephemerides of the Sun and Moon for the years 1598. & 1599. two years before death, and after a long-established practice and experience in observing, he wrote and dedicated to Emperor Rudolph II, which are found in manuscript in the library of the most serene Queen of Sweden."
    ],
    [
      "Sau. It is almost universally undoubted in the literary republic, that the experience of Tycho in observing celestial motions is incomparable with the experience of Riccioli, and far more incomparable with the experience of Cassini;",
      "Therefore, we should not depart from Tycho's observations, both because of his constant study, expertise, and thirty years of experience in observing celestial motions, and because of the multiplicity of instruments and organs, and the very rich royal and imperial aid, and many always in observing skilled ministers and assistants."
    ],
    [
      "Merc. You are right, Sauini."
    ],
    [
      "Sau. Have you noticed in Riccioli's letter the indirect weakening of Tycho's observations, when Riccioli vehemently opposes them being proposed and praised by Leuera, who is inexperienced in observations."
    ],
    [
      "Merc. I noticed; but Leuera has already declared in the preface of his Prod. page 29. that he did not want to waste his life uselessly in observing celestial motions, since there are enough and more than enough observations, which we have from two thousand years ago and beyond, of the men in astronomy, and Uranometry, although he himself knew and fully described all the necessary requirements for correctly performing observations, as can be seen in his Prologue page 127. col. 2. & page 197. col. 2. & 198. up to 200., which requirements, because they are not fulfilled by recent Uranometrists due to inexperience and the difficulty of the doctrine of refractions, and its conjunction with the doctrine of parallaxes;",
      "Therefore, everyone must necessarily err in their observations, because we do not at all attain the knowledge of the motions of the planets and stars under the Zodiac through daily observations of the positions under the Zodiac of the same planets and stars, but through long-lasting observations of the periods and circulations of the same planets and stars under the Zodiac.",
      "Therefore, it is from this that the life of one man is nothing for performing all such observations, since Saturn's circulation is not completed except in a space of almost thirty years, and the circulation of the fixed stars not except in 24,000 years.",
      "But since no mortal has made such observations, nor will make them: Therefore Leuera also declared in the preface of his Prodromus page 23. & 24. & in chapter 4. page 154. that no one will ever attain complete and perfect knowledge of astronomy through observations of the motions and positions of the planets and stars alone, neither his own nor others' made with any even the best instruments, and even with complete experience and practice of refractions raising the planets and stars into the air more than is right, and likewise increasing their diameter; unless with great study in all philosophy, and especially astronomy, and under the guidance of the chief light, he has come to the knowledge also of the number, which the Nature the Creator decreed from eternity for each circulation and period of the motions of the individual spheres and planets and their Apogees and Nodes, and to the knowledge of the harmony, and proportion, and analogy between each circulation and period of the said celestial bodies, namely between the said invented numbers of any circulation, made so far from the beginning of the world, or to be made, as he indicated in the whole said chapter 4. of his Prodromus, which because they are very hidden; Therefore, the complete motions of the planets are not yet had, as Ricciol. himself also confessed in book 9. Almag. his chapter 5. page 268. & Leuera also reports in his Prodromus chapter 9. page 207. Hence it is that both because of the lack of knowledge of these numbers and periods, and because of the lack of many observations, which require a long life, Riccioli did not publish a well-digested Almagest, which he himself also calls a patchwork on page 19. of his preface, and he decreed all celestial motions for the time being, and left them in suspense, and they still remain in suspense after 12 years from the said edition of his Almagest."
    ],
    [
      "Sau. It is now clear, whatever Riccioli may have said, that nothing stands in the way of the doctrine of the Prodromus, whether Leuera observed or did not observe celestial motions, because he has already protested in the said prefaces of his Prodromus that he did not want, nor was able to found astronomy on his observations, as all moderns try in vain to do, but that he began to promulgate the old astronomy of the Egyptians restored from the observations of all the most notable astronomers, and that he was primarily based on their observations and teachings."
    ],
    [
      "Merc. Although the art of observing in a rough way, and with a coarse Minerva is easy, and can be understood very briefly by anyone, even one not educated in astronomy: yet the art of observing exquisitely, perfectly, and precisely to the second scruple, is very difficult for anyone, and can be understood very slowly, because it is learned and acquired only by long stages and labors, and frequent errors in observing, and often correcting them, as is the example in Tycho, who from the year 1570. until the year 1601. learned the art of observing, and he was not ashamed, nor blushed to confess errors in his observations and opinions, and to correct himself from them, as is read in the book Progymn. page 15. & he also recounted the greatest difficulties even about clocks required in observing, as from page 242. & 151. of the same book Progymn. & the imperfections of logarithms, to avoid labors in calculating, as Greimberger also hinted in his Trigonometry, where he speaks of Spherical Triangles page 70. Indeed, errors and hallucinations in observations can be very many both because of the ignorance of refractions and other requirements, and because of the not complete disposition of the observing artisans, even if the instruments with which they use are exquisite and excellent, among which errors Robert Dudley Duke of Northumbria in his very large books of the secrets of the sea, who was a great observer, and inventor of many instruments for observing, and follower and admirer of Tycho, enumerates ten errors of Uranometrists in observing the altitude of the Sun and stars, in which they easily fall, as is read in book 5. of the secrets of the sea page 13. of the second edition.",

      "Merc. I recall that we received Riccioli's new Almagest, and Cassini's Specimen of Observations, and having read in the third book of the Almagest, chapter 15, page 138, Riccioli's observation of the autumnal equinox made in Bologna in the year 1643, on the 22nd of September of the Gregorian calendar at 22:25 p.m., and likewise having read in the said Specimen of Cassini's Observations, page 10, Cassini's observation of the autumnal equinox made in the year 1655, also in Bologna, on the 22nd of September of the new Gregorian calendar at 18:55 p.m., it was found that there does not exist between these equinoxes observed by them in the predicted years, that time difference which is required for the magnitude of the year determined by them, namely about 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, but rather a far different one; for if in the year 1643 the autumnal equinox truly was on the 22nd of September at 22:25 p.m. in Bologna, as Riccioli most meticulously affirms he observed in book 3 of the Almagest, chapter 15, page 138.",
      "Then, twelve years later, namely in the year 1655, according to the magnitude of the year determined by them and by almost all astronomers, the autumnal equinox should have been on the 22nd of September at 20:13 p.m., and not at 18:55, as Cassini observed and affirms in his said booklet of the observations of the years 1655 and 1656, page 10.",

I also recall that from these we reasonably came to suspect the errors of the epochs and tables of Riccioli and Cassini, and again we received Riccioli's Almagest and turning the pages of the Almagest, we found in the said book 3, chapter 15, page 138, columns 1 and 2, the observations of the autumnal equinoxes of the years 1643 and 1646, made most accurately by Riccioli, as he extensively reports there, and we saw that they do not agree with each other, nor can they possibly agree, and therefore the epochs and roots of the Sun's motions derived from them are false;",
      "Moreover, between these two of his observations of the autumnal equinoxes, there is not that time difference which is required for the magnitude of the year pre-defined and determined by him and almost all modern astronomers, of 365 days and 5 hours, 49 minutes approximately: but each year the magnitude of the celestial year would be greater by 20 minutes than it truly is, and than Riccioli himself defined, for if in the year 1643 the autumnal equinox was on the 12th of September of the Julian calendar at 22:25 p.m. in Bologna, Certainly in the following year 1644, which was a leap year, it should have been, according to the magnitude of his celestial year, on the 12th of September at 4:14 p.m. likewise in Bologna; and in the year 1645, it should have been on the 12th of September at 10:02 and a half p.m. and in the said year 1646, in which he himself observed the said autumnal equinox, it should have been according to the magnitude of his celestial year on the 12th of September at 15:51 p.m. likewise in Bologna, not however at 14:56 p.m. as he most accurately affirms he observed.",

Again, Cassinus' account of the truth of his Tables is most suspicious, because when he had them ready, and constructed in the year 1655, when he began to observe the positions of the Sun by a Gnomon made by himself, he proposes a doubt about the motion of the Sun's Apogee, and its mobility on pages 13, 14, 15 of his booklet of his observations:",
      "And similarly, after he has defined the position of the Sun's Apogee, with which he compares his observations made by the Gnomon with his tables, to be in 8.35 degrees of Cancer; he becomes doubtful, and uncertain, proposing a way to know the annual motion of the Apogee by the Gnomon, stating that in 45 years it could be understood, whether the Sun's Apogee is moved forward by one minute each year, and after this still wavering in his Ephemerides of the said five years on page 156, printed in the Ephemerides of Lansberg of the Marquis of Malvasia, he says the Sun's Apogee is found in 7 degrees of Cancer, leading no observation by which the said Sun's Apogee should exist there;",
      "And similarly, he shows himself to be doubtful and uncertain about the quantity of the Solar year, and the Sun's eccentricity on pages 17 and 18 of his booklet, while he proposes that the quantity of the Solar year can be defined by the said Gnomon in the space of four years, more than by the comparison of observations of all times, and about the Eccentricity he says.",
      "Therefore, the eccentricity should still be somewhat reduced, so that the equation in the spring equinox would become less, and the true position of the Sun, promoted by refraction, would be drawn back;",
      "In the autumnal equinox, however, it should be subtracted less, so that the true position of the Sun, which refraction draws back, would be promoted forward."

      "Merc. Therefore, when Cassinus has constructed tables of solar motions before making observations of the same motions by the Gnomon made by himself, and despises, and corrects Tycho's observations of the same solar motions, and does not show from which observations, either his own or others', he has constructed the Roots, Epochs, and Tables of solar motions, and does not agree with Kepler's Tables, as he himself affirms on page 155 of his Ephemerides printed in the said Ephemerides of Lansberg of the Marquis Cornelius of Malvasia, differing from Kepler in the Sun's longitude around the Equinoxes by almost seven minutes, they certainly deserve no trust, for, despising the countless observations of almost all distinguished Astronomers published to the world; who would adhere to assertions, and to observations seen by no one, and kept secret, not knowing by what Instruments, in what place, and for how many years, and how great were the said observations of solar motions; when he has never made mention anywhere of the Observatory, or of the supply of Instruments, or of the other apparatus for observing, and for acquiring skill in observing, and is not yet, as I have heard, forty years old; and even more when the Roots of these Tables of Cassini are hidden, and it does not appear from what principle, namely from what illustrious Era, or Epoch they take their beginning:",
      "But if their Epoch is that which he supposes in the exhibited responsive Letter to Riccioli on page 8, namely in the year of our Lord 940, the root of such an Epoch still lies hidden, and is unknown, namely in what sign, degree, and minute he establishes the mean motion of the Sun for the root of such an Epoch.",
      "Meanwhile, the said Epoch is primarily erroneous, for when he defines the year of Christ 940 to have been the year 1688 from Nabonassar, and the year 1264 from the death of Alexander;",
      "This is clearly against the computation, and chronology of Ptolemy in book 3 of his Almagest chapter 2, because, when according to Ptolemy the year 463 from the death of Alexander was the year 887 from Nabonassar, and according to all Chronologists, and Astronomers, and likewise according to Riccioli in his reformed Chronology foundation 5, and in book 3 of his Almagest chapter 14, page 134, the year 140 of Christ was the said year 463 from the death of Alexander, and the said year 887 from Nabonassar; indeed, adding the 800 years that have passed from the year of Christ 140 to the year of the same 940, to the said years from the death of Alexander 463, and the said years 887 from Nabonassar, there are years from the death of Alexander 1263, and not 1264, as Cassinus wrongly thinks, and there are years from Nabonassar 1687, but otherwise 1688, and therefore in this also the error of Chronology, which he himself unjustly, and inconsiderately imposes on Levera, is clearly his own, and Riccioli's.",
      "This is confirmed by the observation of the autumnal Equinox made by Albategni in the year of the usual Epoch of Christ 883, as Levera fully proves in Prod. chapter 3, page 134, because when the said year of Christ 883 was the year 1206 from the death of Alexander according to Albategni, and Monteregium in Epit. Astron. book 3, proposition 2, it necessarily follows, that adding 57 years to the said years of Christ 883, and the said years of Alexander 1206, the aforementioned year of Christ 940 was the year 1263 from the death of Alexander, not however the year 1264, as Cassinus wrongly calculates, and asserts."

      "Moreover, if Cassini's Tables are constructed according to the magnitude of the year defined by him as 365 days and 5.49 hours, they will also necessarily be enormously erroneous, and always more and more so, because the motions, and entrances of the Sun into these or those signs, degrees, and minutes of the Zodiac from the year of Christ 1655, going back to the said years of Christ 940, namely in the space of 715 years, will be slower by calculations according to the said Tables of Cassini by about 30 minutes of motion, and by about 12 hours of time; and likewise after the said 715 years from the said year of Christ 1655 they will also be slower by about 30 minutes of motion, and by about 12 hours of time, and after 715 years, namely after 1430 years from the said Tables of Cassini, the motions, and entrances of the Sun will be slower by about one degree of motion, and by about one day of time from the true motion, and time of the celestial motion of the Sun, and therefore the daily positions of the Sun through the Zodiac calculated with the said tables of Cassini, the older they will be, and the longer, and longer they will be in the future, the more erroneous they will be by several degrees, just as are also those of other Astronomers thinking the magnitude of the year to be 365 days and 5.49 hours, and calculating the Tables of the mean motion of the Sun according to the ratio of the said magnitude of the year, as Levera notes in Prod. chapter 3, page 114, column 2."

      "Merc. The use of Gnomons was very ancient, and first for indicating hours to the People:",
      "But Methon, an Athenian Mathematician, about 431 years before the advent of Christ, constructed a sundial in the forum of Athens; and properly the Gnomon is that style in the middle of the sundial indicating the hours by its shadow, which Pliny calls the navel of the Sun in book 2 of his natural history, chapter 72.",
      "And the art of Gnomonics is nothing else than the ratio of shadows, which was invented by Anaximenes, as Pliny reports in the said book 2, chapter 76.",
      "There was also a Gnomon in Alexandria of Egypt not only for indicating the hours, but also for deducing the meridian height of the Sun from the shadows of the Gnomon, and especially from the three more notable meridian shadows, namely the Equinoctial, and the Solstitial, both summer and winter, as from the heights of the Sun the meridian shadow, as the Equinoctial meridian shadows were observed at the Gnomon of Alexandria, as is read in Ptolemy book 2, Almagest chapters 2,3,5, and 6, and from the ratio of the Equinoctial shadow to the Gnomon, the height of the Pole of Alexandria was found, as Vitruvius affirms in book 9, chapter 8. So in Massilia, where these sublime sciences always flourished, Pithias of Massilia, about the year 324 before the advent of Christ, observed the summer Solstitial meridian shadow at that Gnomon, as 213.1/8 to 600, and Gassendus in the year of Christ 1635, in the great Conclave of the College of Massilia, with a hole made in the wall facing the south, which was 52 Royal feet high, caught the ray of the Sun at midday of the summer Solstice, and likewise found the summer Solstitial meridian shadow to have the ratio to this Gnomon, as 213.1/8 to 600, as in the time of Pithias; from which he inferred that the distance of the Tropic from the zenith of Massilia is now exactly the same as it was in the time of Pithias, and Alexander the Great, and that the obliquity of the Ecliptic is 23.31 degrees, and leaving aside the observations made by the Gnomon by Eratosthenes for the measurement of the terrestrial Orb, of which Pliny speaks in book 2 of his natural history, chapter 108, and also Strabo in book 2, likewise made for the obliquity of the Ecliptic at Byzantium:",
      "Similarly in Rome Manlius placed a golden ball on the top of the Obelisk, which was in the Campus Martius, to collect the shadow, and to investigate the length of the days in each day of the year, as Pliny also narrates in book 36 of his natural history, chapter 10, for the Obelisk was brought by Augustus from Egypt, 116 feet high, which once belonged to King Sesostris, nine feet shorter than another Obelisk erected by the same Augustus in the Circus Maximus between the Palatine, and the Aventine hill, and it was erected in the Campus Martius in the place of the great Gnomon laid with stone, on which the meridian shadow would fall, a golden ball was added to the top of the Gnomon by the said Manlius, a Mathematician."

      "But although Gnomons could have served conveniently for indicating hours, and for some geographical operations, which do not need subtlety, and precision, yet for astronomical operations, which demand exquisite subtlety, and precision, such as is the investigation of the height of the Pole, and the obliquity of the Ecliptic, or the declination of the Sun from the equator, and the day, and hour, and minute of the time of the Equinoxes, and Solstices, they can hardly be safely used because of the triple error, into which Observers can easily fall, namely parallax, refraction, and the semi-diameter of the Sun; for this error, as Riccioli himself also affirms in book 10 of his Almagest pages 603, and 605, can sometimes exceed 45 minutes in the height of the pole, and almost a whole day in the time of the equinoxes;",
      "In the moments of the solstices, however, it can exceed the error of several days; and he corrects Ptolemy in the height of the pole of Alexandria taken by the meridian shadow observed at the Gnomon, and similarly Maginus in the height of the Pole of Rome investigated by the same meridian shadow observed at the Gnomon, and this Riccioli confirms in book 2 of his Almagest chapter 14, page 133, column 1, when he says, It is a mistake by the Ancients to use the height of the upper margin of the luminaries, whose radius terminates the right shadow for the height of the center of the Sun, for it was necessary to subtract the apparent semi-diameter of the Sun from the height found by the right shadow;",

      "Moreover, they are more difficult to preserve, for they are subject to the injuries of time, and earthquakes, and wear, and the constant trampling of people passing through the path serving the Gnomon, as is read about the Gnomon of the Campus Martius in Pliny's book 36, chapter 10."

      "Moreover, in the pavement of the Bolognese Gnomon, where there are 12 engraved signs of the Zodiac, the minutes are missing; and the lengths of the signs of the Zodiac are very unequal among themselves; and the image or figure of the Sun coming through the hole to the pavement, where the signs of the Zodiac are engraved, sometimes appears more, sometimes less elliptical, and long, and sometimes more, sometimes less round, and therefore elsewhere filling about half of one degree of the Zodiac, and elsewhere filling, and even exceeding one degree of the Zodiac, as can be seen in the figure of the said Bolognese Gnomon printed by Ricciolus in the said book 3. Almag. chapter 14, folio 132, and by the different distances of the image of the Sun in the length of the said path, or Pavement, to the beginnings of the signs, which he calculates in the appendix of his Almag. p. 736.",

      "However, it is enough for wise men to know that Hipparchus, Ptolemy, Albategni, Alphonso, Copernicus, Tycho, and all the other Astronomers never used Gnomons for exquisite Astronomical operations, and Ptolemy confessed the insufficiency of Gnomons in the said book 2.

      "which difficulties Ricciolus himself exclaimed in book 3. Almage. chapter 10, pages 116 and 117, where after many things deduced by Kepler about investigating the magnitude of the Solar diameter, he says:",

The doctrine of motions, however, is different from the doctrine of times of things done, for the doctrine of motions requires knowledge of celestial circulations, and periods, which can be achieved by long studies of observations, and traditions both of ancient and modern Astronomers, but the doctrine of times of things done, because it requires knowledge of the time, in which those illustrious things were done in the world; this knowledge indeed cannot be had except from eyewitnesses, who were present, and personally attended that beginning, and those witnesses should be at least two, to deserve faith;",

      "Secondly, in the same examination of Hipparchus' autumnal equinox observations presented by Levera in the aforementioned chapter 3 of his Prodromus, regarding the question of whether these were truly the years in which Hipparchus observed, we see that the first three observations of the autumnal equinoxes were noted by Levera, according to the enumeration of the years of Callippus, which Ptolemy himself refers to Hipparchus in book 3 of the Almagest, chapter 2. Namely, the first observation was in the 17th year, the second in the 20th year, and the third in the 21st year of the third period of Callippus; then we see that the said first observation of Hipparchus' autumnal equinox fell in the 163rd year after the death of Alexander according to Levera, because as Ricciolus also admits in the said letter, where he speaks of his reformed chronology in foundation 5, and as Levera refers to in the Prodromus, chapter 10, page 229, where he speaks of the epoch of Alexander the Great, and from the text of Ptolemy himself, and from the most exact considerations in the said book 3 of the Almagest, chapter 2, made by Ptolemy;",

The true interval from the beginning of the years of Callippus to the beginning of the years of Alexander is not seven years, but only six years according to the text of Ptolemy, and the most exquisite comparisons made by him in the said chapter 2, book 3 of the Almagest, where he says, from the said 50th year of the first period according to Callippus, as Hipparchus also asserts, which is the 44th year after the death of Alexander etc. Furthermore, because in the observations made by Ptolemy of the spring equinoxes, and the summer solstice of the 463rd year after the death of Alexander, Ptolemy himself calculates that the years that have passed from the beginning of the period of Callippus are 469. For from the 50th year of the first period of Callippus, where there was the observation of the summer solstice of Meton, as Ptolemy reports, 419 years have passed, to which are added the said 50 years, making the said 469 years. Therefore, subtracting 6 years from the said 469 years, there are 463 years after the death of Alexander, as Ptolemy has exquisitely calculated:",
      "Therefore Ricciolo, and other modern chronologists with him, are convicted of falsehood regarding the aforementioned enumeration of the years of Alexander, because the interval between the years of Callippus and Alexander is only six years, not seven years at all, as Ricciolo wrongly thinks in his said reformed chronology."

    [
      "And Ricciolo remains all the more convicted and confessed of error and falsehood in the epoch of Alexander defined and exhibited by him in his reformed chronology in assigning the times of all the autumnal equinox observations of Hipparchus, because successively in assigning the times of all the spring equinox observations of the same Hipparchus, the said interval from the beginning of the years of Alexander was not more than seven years against Ptolemy, but he describes it as being only six years, agreeing with Ptolemy, who in the comparison and consideration of the said observation of the spring equinox made by Hipparchus in the 32nd year of the third period of Callippus, and in the 178th year after the death of Alexander on the 27th day of Mechir, as Ptolemy himself reports in the said book 3 of the Almagest, chapter 2, with his own observation of the spring equinox made in the 463rd year after the death of Alexander on the 7th day of Pachon, Ptolemy establishes an interval of only six years from the said 32nd year of the third period of Callippus, which was the 184th year from the beginning of Callippus to the 178th year of Alexander, for subtracting from these years 184, six years in which the beginning of Callippus preceded the beginning of Alexander, there remain the said 178 years of Alexander.

      "That the said 32nd year of the third period of Callippus was the said 178th year after the death of Alexander, as Ptolemy also reports, and is admitted by all chronologists and astronomers, is also confirmed by the same Ptolemy above: for in this his observation of the spring equinox made, as he affirms, 285 years after the said first observation of the spring equinox of Hipparchus, if the said 285 years are added to the said 178 years after the death of Alexander, they make up 473 years after the death of the same Alexander, in which Ptolemy testifies that he made the said observation of the spring equinox above.",
      "In the computation of the years of Callippus and Alexander it is difficult to err, when we are in the spring equinoxes observed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy, because both the beginnings of the years of Callippus and Alexander always precede the spring equinoxes following them:",
      "But in the autumnal equinoxes it is easy to be mistaken, because the beginning of the years of Callippus always precedes the autumnal equinoxes, from which it was in the summer solstice;",
      "And the beginning of the years of Alexander always follows the autumnal equinoxes, because it was in the month of November."

    [
      "From the above also Ricciolo remains convicted, because although the year of the fourth autumnal observation of Hipparchus truly fell in the 177th year after the death of Alexander, according to the common opinion of almost all astronomers, among whom are Copernicus in book 3, chapter 13, Bullialdus in book 2, Astr. Phil. chapter 2, as Ricciolo also admits in his said reformed chronology; yet it could not have been that year, the 32nd of the third period of Callippus, namely the 184th year from the beginning of the years of Callippus, nor could the year of the fifth autumnal observation of Hipparchus, which followed successively, although it truly fell in the 178th year after the death of Alexander, yet it could not have been the 33rd year of the third period of Callippus, namely the 185th year from the beginning of the years of Callippus; for the interval between these years of Callippus and these years of Alexander would have been seven years. Nor does the saying of Ptolemy hinder, that the said fourth observation of the autumnal equinox of Hipparchus was in the 32nd year of the third period of Callippus; and the fifth observation of the autumnal equinox of Hipparchus was in the 33rd year of the third period of Callippus: for in these two autumnal observations Hipparchus assumed the beginning years of Callippus, or the beginning years:",
      "In the preceding three autumnal observations he assumed the ending years of Callippus, or the completed years, and therefore the last of the said three autumnal observations following eleven years of beginning, and ten years of completion:",
      "For we are forced to admit that the said years of Callippus in the said fourth and fifth observation of Hipparchus were noted by Ptolemy as beginning, and not as completed, so that the said interval of six years from the beginning of Alexander may be preserved, as declared, affirmed, and repeated by the same Ptolemy above;",
      "Therefore, the year of the fourth autumnal observation necessarily was the 31st of the third period of Callippus completed, and the 32nd running, and therefore the 183rd year from the beginning of the years of Callippus, from which subtracting six years there are the said 177 years after the death of Alexander, and the year of the fifth autumnal observation following it was the 32nd of the third period of Callippus completed, and the 33rd running, and consequently the 184th year from the beginning of the years of Callippus, from which likewise subtracting six years there was the year 178 after the death of Alexander."

      "That the year of the fourth autumnal observation of Hipparchus truly fell in the 177th year after the death of Alexander, is also clear from Ptolemy himself, because since from this autumnal observation to the following observation of the spring equinox made by the same Hipparchus, as Ptolemy notes, in the 178th year after the death of Alexander, six months have passed, and then six other months to the other observation of the autumnal equinox made by the same Hipparchus, as Ptolemy also notes, in the 178th year after the death of Alexander:",

      "For since the spring equinox observed by the same Ptolemy successively after the preceding autumnal equinox, was in the 463rd year after the death of Alexander from the same Ptolemy: ",
      "Indeed, the autumnal equinox immediately preceding it necessarily was in the 462nd year after the death of Alexander, because the beginning of the years of Alexander, is not before the autumnal equinoxes, but after the autumnal equinoxes, and therefore in the said second observation of the autumnal equinox of Ptolemy, the year 462 of Alexander was still running, and the year 463 could not begin until the month of November, and so after the said autumnal equinox observed by Ptolemy."

Moreover, we see that Levera did not establish the doctrine of solar and sidereal motions on just a few observations, and those ambiguous and doubtful, but on many unquestionable observations, documents, and traditions of the most famous of all astronomers, and also philosophers, and not simply geometers, or uranometrists, from which he obtained certainty of the returns and periods of all motions, both in the fourth solar sphere and in the eighth sphere of the splendid fixed stars through long studies, as seen through the many arithmetic demonstrations, which he leads in his Prodromus, and which he lists in c.9. from page 224. And therefore, Riccioli and Cassini would need to not only destroy and overthrow Tyconic astronomy to overthrow Levera's Prodromus doctrine, but also all the documents and traditions of Hipparchus, Ptolemy, Albategni, and other notable astronomers because of the consensus and colligation of the whole doctrine of solar motions described in the Prodromus with the observations and doctrine of all the aforementioned astronomers;",

Indeed, through the solid experience of many examples, it is now clear that both the Tables of Mean Motions and the Tables of Maximum Solar Years, written by Leuera in his Prodomus, excellently provide the minute locations of the Sun in every past and future age. No astronomer, through their tables, comes closer than Leuera himself in the calculations of the Autumnal and Vernal Equinoxes long observed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy, to the times of such observations, namely to the true year, true day, and hours of Hipparchus and Ptolemy's observations, made with as much diligence and care as they could muster.",
      "For the first observation of Hipparchus' Autumnal Equinox, calculations made both through the Tables of Mean Motions and the Tables of Maximum Solar Years, both in chapter 12, page 273, and in chapter 13, page 292 of Leuera's Prodomus, agree almost to the hour with Hipparchus' said observation, which, as it seems, was in the year 169 of the Calippic period, and 163 after the death of Alexander, and 161 before the Epoch of Christ on the 30th day of Messori at the setting of the Sun, which month and day all Chronologists, including Riccioli, correspond to our 27th of September.",

      "But according to all modern astronomers, and their Solar Tables, who estimate the size of the year to be about 49 minutes above 5 hours and 365 days, and thus one minute of time later than it really is, among whom is Riccioli; the said Equinox would have been wrongly one day, or about 24 hours earlier, than it was observed by Hipparchus, and calculated by Leuera, and thus would have been on the 26th of September, for the anticipation of the Equinoxes in 1800 years, according to the size of the year estimated by them, and by Riccioli, is 14 days, as he calculates in book 3 of his Almagest, chapter 15, page 138, in examples, when in truth, according to the true celestial size of the year, 365 days and 5 hours 48 minutes, the said anticipation of the equinoxes in 1800 years is precisely 15 days, as is clear in Leuera's Prodomus chapter 12, page 277, and the difference between this ancient observation, and modern observations derived from Tycho, of the autumnal equinox of the year of Christ 1640 is also exactly 15 days, as can be seen in the said Prodomus of Leuera chapter 12, page 281."

      "It has always been uncertain, and unexplored by anyone until our age, how many minutes of time this excess of Julian intercalation imports each year because of the uncertainty of the true magnitude of the Celestial year; but since by divine help it has happened that Levera has known this excess to have always been, and will be 12 minutes of time each year, and therefore every four Julian years, not one day, but 23.12 hours, and truly every 120 Julian years to be one day of 24 hours precisely, since the true magnitude of the Celestial year always was, and will be 365 days and 5.48 hours, as he fully proves in the whole of chapters 3 and 4, and in chapter 17 from page 381 of his Prodromus by many invincible Arithmetical proofs, and by many examples, and experiments both by the Tables of the mean motions of the Sun, and by the Tables of the maximum solar years in chapters 11, 12, and 13, and by other Tables of solar revolutions in chapters 14, 15, 16, as he notes in chapter 9 of his Prodromus from page 224."

      "From the same maximum solar year of 120 years, both the days, and the hours, and minutes of time of the anticipation of the Equinoxes of any preceding Equinox in any multitude of years from any exquisitely observed Equinox are known most exquisitely, by adding for investigating past Equinoxes one day of 24 hours precisely every 120 Julian years from the said observed Equinox; ",

      "However, this ancient Spring Equinox, first observed by Hipparchus, was on the 25th day of March, and for several hours even after midday, is derived from the aforementioned observation of Riccioli in the year 1647, on the 10th day of March of the Julian year at 5:56 p.m. in Bologna, and due to the difference in meridians at 7:39 p.m. in Alexandria, because when the addition of 5 hours 49 minutes is made to the present Equinoxes, as has been said, the truth of the successive and future Equinoxes becomes clear;",
      "If eight times 5 hours 49 minutes are added to the day, and to the hours and minutes of the Spring Equinox of the year of Christ 1647, the number of years between the said year 1647 and the year of Christ 1655 is calculated, the time of the Spring Equinox of the year 1655 is on the 10th day of March of the Julian year at 6:10 p.m. in Alexandria.",
      "Therefore, if 15 days are added to this time of the Spring Equinox, which have passed from this Spring Equinox to the ancient Spring Equinox first observed by Hipparchus in the said year 146 before the Epoch of Christ, and 178 after the death of Alexander, over a period of 1800 years, which was around midday, as it seemed; the time of the true Spring Equinox is on the 25th of March at 6:10 p.m., derived from the said observation of Riccioli in the year 1647, and thus six hours later than that Equinox observed by Hipparchus, which excess of several hours later is undoubtedly to be attributed to the imperfection of this observation of Riccioli."

      "Finally, let the truth of the year, month, day, and hours of the autumnal and vernal observations of Hipparchus be clearer by anticipating exactly 15 days, for if the autumnal Equinox observed by Cassini in the year 1655, the third after the Leap Year on the 12th of September of the Julian year at 6:55 p.m. in Bologna, and reduced to the meridian of Alexandria at 8:38 p.m. is compared with the ancient autumnal Equinox preceding it by 1800 years, and thus with that fifth observed by Hipparchus in the year 146 before the Epoch of Christ, and 178 after the death of Alexander, also the third after the Leap Year, which was on the 27th of September in the morning, namely at about 6 p.m., as has been demonstrated above also from Levera in Prodromus chapter 3, page 104, and from Table 34 of the Equinoxes; and therefore if 15 days are added, which have passed from the said autumnal Equinox of Cassini to this ancient autumnal Equinox fifth observed by Hipparchus, the time of the said Equinox is on the 27th of September at 8:38 p.m., very close to the hour, let alone the day of Hipparchus' observation, because there is no excess except of about two hours from the said 15 days of anticipation."

      "That Spring Equinox of the year 145 before the Epoch of Christ of the Leap Year, was about 6 hours later than the preceding Spring Equinox observed by Hipparchus in the said year 146 before the Epoch of Christ, and 178 after the death of Alexander, and thus on the 24th of March at about 6 p.m., because the preceding one was observed almost at midday, and therefore if 15 days are added, which have passed from the said ancient Spring Equinox to this Spring Equinox observed by Cassini in the year 1656, the time of such an ancient Spring Equinox of the old year 145 before the Epoch of Christ is on the 24th of March at 11:33 p.m., and thus about 5 hours later: However, the time of this Equinox exceeds by about five hours the said 15 days of due anticipation between these two Spring Equinoxes, namely one ancient, the other modern over a period of 1800 years, due to Cassini's not exquisite observation of this Spring Equinox of the year 1656, as it becomes more notorious if this same ancient Spring Equinox following after another Equinox also of Spring observed by Hipparchus almost at midday on the 25th of March, the third after the Leap Year, which as has been said, fell according to the ratio of the preceding observation of Hipparchus on the 24th of March of the Leap Year at about 6 p.m.",
      "If it is compared, I say, with the Spring Equinox of the same year 1656, also of the Leap Year, deducted from the observations of Tycho, which was on the 9th of March of the Julian year at 7:09 p.m. in Uraniborg, but in Alexandria at 8:44 p.m. and therefore over a period of 1800 years after 15 days with an excess of about 3 hours; therefore if the said 15 days are added to the said 9th day of March, the time of such a Spring Equinox of the time of Hipparchus is on the 24th of March at 8:44 p.m., and thus only about 3 hours later than the aforementioned ancient Equinox, which lateness is rather to be attributed to the imperfection of Hipparchus' observations, than to Tycho's observations, and even more so the excess, or lateness of about five hours of Cassini in this same Spring Equinox, is to be attributed to his imperfect observation."
    ],
    [
      "Therefore, that every 120 Solar years precisely one day of 24 hours of anticipation of the Equinoxes is due in the Julian Civil year, is not only clear from the deductions and comparisons hitherto made, and from the comparisons of the ancient and modern observations mutually of Hipparchus with Tycho, and also of Riccioli, and Cassini's autumnal observations, but also from the comparisons, and considerations of other ancient observations mutually, and with the modern, and more recent ones; for from the observation of the Spring Equinox made by Ptolemy in the year of Christ 140, Leap Year, which was on the 22nd of March at about 1 p.m. in Alexandria up to the observation also of the Spring Equinox made by Tycho in the year of Christ 1580, also Leap Year, which was on the 9th of March at 10:21 p.m. in Uraniborg and reduced to the meridian of Alexandria by the addition of 1 hour 35 minutes was at 11:56 p.m. Since between these two observations there is an anticipation of exactly about 12 days in the Julian Civil year;",
      "And that over a period of 1440 years, which are precisely twelve times 120 years. Therefore, every 120 solar years precisely one day of anticipation of the Equinoxes is due in the Julian Civil year."

    [
      "Moreover, since from the said first observation of the autumnal Equinox made by Hipparchus before the usual Epoch of Christ in the year 161, Leap Year on the 27th of September at the setting of the Sun, namely at about 6 p.m. up to the said autumnal Equinox also from Tycho's observations most accurately deducted in the year of Christ 1642, Leap Year on the 12th of September of the Julian year at 6:26 p.m. reduced to the meridian of Alexandria by addition, as above 1 hour 35 minutes, an anticipation of precisely about 15 days has been made, as it seemed, from which between both observations 1800 years have passed, which years are precisely 15 times 120 years, therefore every 120 solar years exactly one day of anticipation is due in the Julian Civil year."
    ],
    [
      "Therefore, as it seemed, every 120 solar years exactly one day is due, because then only the Sun returns at one and the same moment of time to the same point of the Zodiac, and of any given horizon, as it had returned in the year 120 immediately preceding.",
      "Hence it follows that by the Golden Rule of proportion not only the days, but also the hours of any anticipation in any multitude of years become known, and therefore since from the observations of the autumnal Equinox, and of the Spring Equinox made by Ptolemy in the year of the usual Epoch of Christ 139, and in the year 462 after the death of Alexander up to those of the Autumnal Equinox, and of Spring of Hipparchus, going back to the years before Christ 146, and after the death of Alexander 178, 284 years have passed, it follows that the anticipation of the Equinoxes was by two days, and eight hours, and 48 minutes precisely although Scaliger in book 4, de emend. temp. pages 192, and 193, thought that in 285 years there should have been two days, and 5 hours, as Levera reports in Prodromus chapter 3, page 103. Therefore, adding to the Spring Equinox of Ptolemy of the year 139 from the Epoch of Christ, which was on the 22nd of March at 7:08 p.m. the said two days, and 8 hours 48 minutes, was the Spring Equinox observed by Hipparchus in the said year 146 before the Epoch of Christ, and 178 after the death of Alexander, and the third after the Leap Year on the 25th of March at 3:56 p.m. and adding to the following Spring Equinox of Ptolemy of the year of Christ 140, which was on the 22nd of March at about 1 p.m. the said two days, and 9 hours, because it was the year 285 from the Spring Equinox following from the said observation of Hipparchus, and therefore in the year 145 before the Epoch of Christ, and 179 after the death of Alexander, and also Leap Year, fell the Spring Equinox of this year following after the said observation of Hipparchus also of Spring on the 24th of March at about 9:44 p.m. However, this defect of about 5 hours earlier also in the said Spring Equinox observed by Hipparchus in the said year 146 before Christ, and after the death of Alexander 178, is rather to be attributed to Hipparchus than to Ptolemy, because the anticipation of days, which exists from the Spring Equinoxes observed by Tycho to the Spring Equinox of Ptolemy, agrees exquisitely to the ratio of one day in every 120 Solar years."

To these, it seems, half a day is owed, specifically 12 hours exactly, according to the anticipation of one day every 120 years;",
      "Necessarily, 12 hours must have passed precisely, otherwise it would be 9:11. This deficiency of almost three hours up to 12 hours is undoubtedly due to Cassini's observation, not Tycho's observation, especially since Tycho's Vernal observations are based on the true Equinox observations of Ptolemy and Hipparchus, as mentioned, who are almost unanimous witnesses, and of the highest exception."
    ],
    [
      "This notable year, consisting of 120 solar years, which is rightly called the greatest, is splendidly confirmed by the tables of the average movements of the Sun, and the solar apogee in the Prologue of Leuera chapters 11, 12, and 13. Unless these were very accurate both to the minute of any given time and any given motion, they could not provide any positions of the Sun in any age as accurately as they always do, down to the minute of both time and motion, as is evident from many examples given in said chapters 12 and 13. But they would be erroneous by several degrees, and days in recording solar motions, and the positions of the sun throughout the Zodiac in all ages, and always more so, the older the positions of the sun are sought, as are all the tables of all other Astronomers, who have neither discovered the true magnitude of the Celestial year, nor the motion of the solar apogee, nor will any mortal ever be able to discover it through their own observations due to the brevity of life's course.",
      "And since the greatest solar year cannot be but 120 years, because the true magnitude of the Celestial year is only 365 days, and 5 hours 48 minutes. Therefore, all other greatest solar years of 133 years, and 130, and 127 years, are erroneous, because they are inflated by a greater magnitude of the year than it truly is;",
      "And given a greater year, as mentioned, by one minute of time, there is necessarily a smaller anticipation of the Equinoxes after 1800 years, in 1800 minutes of time, which amount to 30 hours, namely one day, and six hours over, because the sun's motion through the Zodiac in that case is, and is assumed to be slower, than it truly is, and conversely given a shorter year by one minute of time, there is necessarily a greater anticipation of days by one day, and six hours over, because the sun's motion through the Zodiac in that case is, and is faster;",
      "And therefore it follows from this, that all tables of the average motions of the sun of any Astronomers estimating a greater magnitude of the year, than it truly is by one minute namely 365 days, 5 hours 49 minutes, and not 48, among whom are Cassini, and almost Riccioli, present the sun's motion through the Zodiac in 1800 years as slower by one degree, and 15 minutes, than it truly is; and hence it also follows, that in that case the anticipation of days is less by one day, and 6 hours approx. than it truly is, and hence when it should be 15 days, it is hardly 14 days, as mentioned above, and is seen.",
      "And finally, that the greatest solar year should be 120 years, is abundantly proven by Leuera in the Prologue chapter 4. throughout, with many invincible Arithmetic demonstrations, and in chapter 14. where he reveals the triple revolution of solar motions hitherto unknown to the Literary Republic for the splendid utilities in Medicine, and natural Astrology; and permitted; and finally in chapter 17. on fixed Stars, where he explores, and invincibly demonstrates the nexus, and connection between the Tropical year, and the Sidereal year."
    ],
    [
      "From these final examinations, it was fully seen that Leuera neither fell, as Riccioli supposed, into errors, nor into Chronological hallucinations of motions, nor of solar motion times in assigning his time to the observations of Hipparchus, and Ptolemy, namely not only years, but also days, and hours, in which they were truly made, and in which the Equinoxes truly occurred in that age."
    ],
    [
      "Moreover, we have seen the tables of both the average motion of the Sun, and the greatest solar years explored by Leuera, exhibiting the positions, and daily places of the Sun in any age as agreeing not only with all the positions of the Sun observed by Tycho, but also with the positions of the Sun observed by Hipparchus, and Ptolemy, and other notable Astronomers of all centuries, and even almost with the autumnal position of the Sun of the year 1643. more diligently observed by Riccioli, to be incomparably more acceptable than all other tables enormously disagreeing with the positions of the Sun observed by all ancient, and modern Astronomers; and because of this Consensus, and Connection of the whole doctrine of solar motions described in the Prologue with the observations, and doctrine of the most approved Astronomers of all, without doubt, the magnitude of the Celestial year proposed by Leuera, and lucidly demonstrated in his entire Prologue, must be adhered to, until the contrary is invincibly proven."

      "So much more will he be mistaken with Riccioli in others' observations, and traditions, and in pursuing Leuera's doctrine."

      "Therefore, unless he declares himself, and proposes objections, and arguments in a proving form, he cannot be answered in any way.",
      "Secondly, regarding the magnitude of the year explored by Leuera, he should present and demonstrate the logical circle he claims, otherwise his assertion is empty, putting nothing into existence, which becomes clear to the reader of chapters 3, 4, 12, and 13 of the Prodromus, in which the true magnitude of the celestial year is fully demonstrated."
    ],
    [
      "Thirdly, the contradiction claimed by Cassino regarding the delay of the Sun, has no foundation, which is also clear to the reader and the understanding of chapters 5, 6, and 9 from page 210 of Leuera's Prodromus, for Cassinus considers the delay and the year to be the same, and therefore, since the year according to Leuera is 365 days and 5.48 hours, he says the average delay of the Sun should be 182 days and 14.54 hours, which is half of the year;",
      "But the delay of the Sun, which Leuera speaks of, is not the Sun's delay throughout the entire Zodiac, but is the Sun's delay in the northern semicircle of the Zodiac, starting from ♈ through 69, up to ♎︎ and in the other southern semicircle of the Zodiac, starting from ♎︎ through ♑ to ♈. This delay is threefold, the maximum being 186 days and 18.46 hours, the average being 184 days and 16.45 hours, and the minimum being 178 days and 11.2 hours. This triple delay only becomes noticeably changeable after many centuries in the northern semicircle of the Zodiac to the southern, and from the southern to the northern."

      "Fourthly, Cassinus objects that Leuera changes the average motions of the Sun, to the equation of variation, even though, he says, he admits that they are always equal, adding, from what source this comes is easily seen in the calculations; and indeed this objection is frivolous, and concludes nothing, because from the calculation of 70 places of the sun of many centuries through the tables of the average motions of the sun of Leuera's Prodromus in chapter 13, it is clearly understood by any calculators, how exquisite their precision is, and their calculations.",
      "Moreover, this objection does not stand, because Leuera never varies the average motions of the sun to the variation of equations, as can be seen in the said 70 examples, or calculations in his entire Prodromus of motions, and positions of the sun from six thousand years ago, but he firmly concludes that the average motion of the sun is perpetually unchangeable, as can be read in chapter 9 of the same Prodromus page 221.",

It would have been better to object that Leuera wrongly varies the average motions of the sun to the variation of equations, since according to Leuera, the average motions of the sun are perpetually unchangeable, not however to say perpetually equal; for who in Astronomy, even rudely initiated, can doubt whether the average motion of the sun is perpetually equal, since it is therefore called average, because it is perpetually between the slow, and the fast motion of the sun;",

      "The second is the parts of the solar eccentricity extended on page 178.",
      "The first table is for investigating the diversity of the sun's delay in both the northern and southern semicircles of the Zodiac in any distant centuries.",
      "The second table is for investigating the difference in time of the sun's entries at the equinox points, which the change implies, and therefore the difference of the sun's center equation, which has been made from some given old century up to the present century at the said equinox points, resulting from the motion, and position of the solar apogee of the said old, and present century, and its apogee subtractions from the same average longitude of the sun, which is due to both the said old sun's place, and the same place of the present sun at the equinox points according to the root, or first epoch, of the average motions of the sun, as Leuera teaches in the use, and examples of the said second table page 178, and in chapter 9 page 208. The use of this second table is daily in all calculations of the sun's places, as can be seen in chapter 13, where no calculation of the sun is made much before, or after the first epoch of the year 1588, unless the said difference of the sun's center equation is used, therefore its use does not escape notice, except to those who neglect it; but the use of the first table is rarer, because the sun's apogee is of the slowest motion, and very slowly enters into new signs of the Zodiac; however, its use is not only explained by examples in the said page 177, column one, but more extensively above in the same chapter 6 from page 165.",
