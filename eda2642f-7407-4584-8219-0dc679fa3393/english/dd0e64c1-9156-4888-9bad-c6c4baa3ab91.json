      "A Dialogue has come to me, through which a full response is given to two letters recently published by Riccioli and Cassini against the Prodromus of Francesco Levera, follower of Tycho:",
      "and because in the response to these two letters many things are resolved, and masterfully clarified, they are most worthy of knowledge, and very useful, and they fully understand the Prodromus of Levera, and its use, both in terms of the chronology of movements, and times of celestial solar movements, as well as the chronology of times of significant events in the world, and about the anticipation of true equinoxes in the Julian civil year, explored by Levera himself, and its practice, and remarkable use;",
      "and about the errors of recent Astronomers in constructing tables, and roots of celestial movements, and ephemerides through their observations, disregarding the observations of Tycho, and all others, not agreeing with theirs;",
      "as well as in calculating celestial movements in all past, and future ages.",
      "Therefore, I decided to publish them, so that the most noble students of these arts may enjoy the benefits, and very special utilities coming from their full knowledge, both in Astronomy itself, and movements of other planets, and stars, as well as in permissible Astrology, and Medicine, and the art of Navigation.",
      "Along with the Dialogue, I ordered the said two letters of Riccioli, and Cassini to be printed, placing them in the edition beforehand, so that the opposing views may shine more clearly to the reader. Farewell."
