        "note": "A criticism of the theory of the spinning Earth (in Heliocentrism or otherwise) at the time was that the motion was not felt by anyone on Earth. It is often believed that experiments of movement on a boat allowed the explanation of a lack of feeling of movement, but this example here confuses things. Galileo was clearly aware that acceleration and deceleration of a boat could be observed in water contained within the boat. He then claims that this is what could be happening to the Earth and moving the oceans. But he doesn't question why no-one can feel this change in speed on the Earth, or why it should affect water but not other objects.",

        "line": 61,
        "language": "english",
        "note": "This section is particularly interesting, as Galileo compares the movement of the tides to a pendulum. This motion is referred to as simple harmonic motion. Simple Harmonic motion would later be used to create the generic models of tides unconstrained by land and lead to the modern explanation of tides. In fact, an extension to a Forced Harmonic Motion can then explain why tidal bulges do not directly face the moon. Unfortunately Galileo's rejection of a lunar effect stopped him from reaching these conclusions.",
